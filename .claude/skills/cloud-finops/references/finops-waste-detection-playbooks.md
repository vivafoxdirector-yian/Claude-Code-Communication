# FinOps Waste Detection Playbooks

> Waste detection is the most concrete entry point to Cloud FinOps. Unlike
> commitment strategy or chargeback, waste hunting produces realised savings
> in the first month, with low organisational change required. This file is
> the OptimNow taxonomy for systematic waste detection - what to hunt for,
> how to detect it, how to fix it safely, and how to track realised savings
> over time.
>
> Operationally, OptimNow runs the **WasteLine** appliance - a private,
> read-only AWS waste-assessment tool with 49 detection rules across the
> resource-state categories below. WasteLine automates the
> detection-and-classification
> work; this file is the doctrine the appliance encodes. For Azure and GCP,
> use the in-cloud catalogues (`finops-azure-patterns.md`, `finops-gcp.md`)
> until WasteLine extends to those providers.

## The eight waste categories

Every cloud waste pattern fits into one of eight categories. Understanding the
category drives the detection method, the classification confidence, and the
fix-safety posture.

| Category | What it is | Typical $ impact | Classification confidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Orphaned** | Resource exists but no longer serves any workload | High per-resource, easy to spot | Usually obvious; some "DR-just-in-case" exceptions |
| **Idle** | Resource is attached and running but does no useful work | Variable; multiplied across many resources | Usually likely; needs two signals to confirm |
| **Overprovisioned** | Resource works but is sized far above observed demand | High aggregate; needs methodology to right-size | Usually possible; needs workload-owner sign-off |
| **Commitment mismatches** | RIs / Savings Plans / CUDs underutilised, expiring soon, or covering the wrong things | High dollar, low complexity to fix | Usually obvious in the data; political to act on |
| **Schedule blindness** | Workload runs 24/7 with a clear business-hours pattern | Variable; 60-70% savings on dev / test environments | Usually likely; depends on workload sensitivity |
| **Modernization opportunities** | Workload runs on older-generation instances or pre-Graviton x86_64 when ARM equivalents exist | 10-40% per workload, low risk | Usually possible; revalidation required |
| **AI / ML inefficiency** | SageMaker endpoints idle, Bedrock provisioned throughput underutilised, training jobs on-demand instead of Spot | High per-workload, growing rapidly | Usually likely; product team has the context |
| **Egress / data transfer** | Traffic is billed for crossing a boundary (AZ, region, VPC, internet) that the architecture did not need to cross | High and compounding at scale; frequently a top-5 line item | Usually possible; needs traffic attribution before anyone will act |

These categories are not equal in priority. **Orphaned and idle** are where
most engagements should start - low-risk wins build the credibility for
harder commitment and modernization work later. **Commitment mismatches and
modernization** should land after at least one quarter of orphaned/idle
hunting has produced realised savings. **Egress** is last: it is the only
category whose fix is usually an architecture change rather than a
configuration change, so it needs the credibility the other seven earn.

---

## Cross-category detection principles

### Two-signal classification rule

Never act on a single metric. The two-signal rule:

- **Compute idle** = low CPU AND low network for 30+ days (not CPU alone)
- **Idle load balancer** = no traffic AND no healthy targets (not just one)
- **Orphaned snapshot** = parent volume deleted AND not referenced by an AMI
- **NAT Gateway zombie** = low data processed AND route-table review confirms
  no active subnets depend on it

Single-signal detection produces false positives that erode trust. Two
signals reduce false-positive rates dramatically without losing real waste.

### Classification confidence tiering

Every detection should land in one of three confidence tiers:

| Tier | Definition | Action |
|---|---|---|
| **Obvious** | Both detection signals strongly positive; no plausible defensive use | Auto-decommission with snapshot + 30-day grace period |
| **Likely** | Both signals positive; some plausible exceptions exist | Owner notification with 14-day deadline; decommission on ack or timeout |
| **Possible** | One strong signal, one ambiguous; needs context | Owner conversation; decommission only after explicit approval |

The classification keeps the decommission workflow safe. Obvious waste does
not need a meeting; possible waste cannot be batched.

### Realised savings vs potential savings

The only number that matters is **realised savings**: monthly baseline
minus monthly post-cleanup cost, sustained for at least 60 days. Stop
reporting "potential savings" - stakeholders learn to discount these
within one quarter and the credibility of the FinOps practice degrades.

### Use FOCUS columns for inventory scope

For any cross-cloud or multi-account waste hunt, scope inventory queries
through FOCUS columns:

- `ServiceCategory='Compute' or 'Networking' or 'Storage'`
- `ChargeClass IS NULL` (exclude refunds and corrections from the baseline)
- `EffectiveCost` per `ChargePeriod` for prioritisation by dollar impact
- `ResourceId`, `ResourceType` to filter to the resource class being hunted

Provider-native columns (CUR `line_item_*`, Azure Cost Management, BigQuery
billing export) work too but break cross-cloud reuse. Default to FOCUS
where the data exists.

---

## Category 1: Orphaned resources

### Pattern shape

Resource exists in the cloud account but no longer serves any workload.
Typical sources:

- Migration leftovers (the volume from the test instance that was deleted
  six months ago)
- "Just-in-case" snapshots from one engineering experiment that compounded
  over years
- Decommissioned services where the load balancer was kept but never
  removed
- Account consolidation where elastic IPs were detached but never released

### Common patterns

| Pattern | Signal | Detection approach |
|---|---|---|
| Unattached EBS volumes (or equivalents) | `Attachment State = available`, `LastAttached > 14 days` | Inventory across regions; cross-reference with snapshot history |
| Orphaned EBS snapshots | Source volume ID does not exist; AMI reference does not exist | Snapshot age + parent-volume status query |
| Unassociated Elastic IPs | EIP allocated, no association to running resource | Direct inventory; ~$3.60/month each (illustrative us-east-1 list rate as at August 2026; all public IPv4 has been charged since February 2024, attached or not - see Category 8) |
| Empty S3 buckets without lifecycle | Object count = 0, no lifecycle policy, age > 90 days | List buckets, filter by metadata - never enumerate objects |
| Security groups with no attached interfaces | No ENI references, no ALB/NLB reference, no Lambda VPC config reference | Reverse-lookup query |
| AMIs with no running instances | AMI ID not referenced by any instance, launch template, or ASG | Cross-reference inventory |
| ECR repositories without lifecycle | Repository exists, no lifecycle policy, last push > 90 days | Repository metadata query |
| Stale incomplete S3 multipart uploads | Multipart upload initiated > 7 days ago, never completed | S3 multipart inventory |
| Secrets Manager secrets not accessed in 90+ days | Secret exists, `LastAccessedDate > 90 days` | CloudTrail-derived access pattern |

### Detection example (orphaned EBS volumes via FOCUS)

```sql
SELECT
  ResourceId,
  ResourceType,
  Region,
  EffectiveCost AS monthly_cost,
  Tags
FROM focus_data
WHERE ServiceCategory = 'Storage'
  AND ResourceType = 'EBS Volume'
  AND ChargeClass IS NULL
  AND ChargePeriodStart >= current_date - interval '30' day
  -- Cross-reference with EC2 inventory: include only volumes
  -- that are NOT attached to any running instance
  AND ResourceId NOT IN (
    SELECT volume_id FROM ec2_volume_attachments
    WHERE attachment_state = 'attached'
  )
ORDER BY monthly_cost DESC;
```

### Fix sequence

1. **Snapshot before delete** for any storage resource. Snapshot cost is
   pennies; restoring deleted production data costs careers.
2. **Owner identification**: tag-based first, account-context fallback.
   If no owner can be identified, the resource enters a 30-day grace
   period with a `wasteline-orphan-pending-deletion` tag.
3. **Notification**: owner gets 14 days to claim or refute. No reply =
   continue with deletion.
4. **Decommission with rollback path**: snapshot retained for 30 days
   post-delete in case the resource turns out to have been load-bearing
   in a way nobody surfaced.
5. **Realised savings**: monthly baseline - monthly post-cleanup, tracked
   to the resource ID.

### Anti-patterns

- **Bulk delete without owner notification**. Even "obvious" orphans can
  be load-bearing in unexpected ways.
- **Skipping the snapshot step** for EBS or RDS resources. Recovery is
  cheap; data loss is not.
- **Treating empty S3 buckets as orphans without lifecycle check**. A
  bucket with `WriteOnly` access from a Lambda may legitimately appear
  empty between batch runs.

---

## Category 2: Idle resources

### Pattern shape

Resource is attached, running, and being billed, but does no useful work
during the observation window.

### Common patterns

| Pattern | Signal (both required) | Detection approach |
|---|---|---|
| Stopped EC2 for 7+ days | EC2 state `stopped`, EBS still billed | EC2 inventory + EBS attachment query |
| Idle load balancer | Zero healthy targets AND zero `RequestCount` over 14 days | CloudWatch metric query |
| CloudWatch Log Groups with no events | `LastEventTime > 30 days`, no events ingested | Log Group metadata |
| NAT Gateway low data | < 5 GB/month processed, averaged over 60 days, hourly charge dominates | CloudWatch `BytesOutToDestination` query |
| S3 bucket with zero requests | `AllRequests` metric = 0 over 60 days | CloudWatch S3 metrics |
| Lambda with zero invocations | `Invocations` = 0 over 30 days | CloudWatch Lambda metrics |
| DynamoDB table with no read/write | `ConsumedRead/WriteCapacity` = 0 over 30 days | CloudWatch DDB metrics |
| Redshift cluster low activity | CPU < 5% AND `DatabaseConnections` near zero | CloudWatch Redshift metrics |

### Detection example (NAT Gateway zombies)

```sql
-- NAT Gateway hours vs data processed, last two full months (Athena over
-- CUR 2.0). The window is deliberately 60 days, not 14: some workloads run
-- quarterly, and a short quiet window misclassifies them as zombies.
-- The NatGateway-Bytes usage amount is already reported in GB (the pricing
-- unit), despite the usage-type name - do not divide it down from bytes.
-- Dividing by 2 turns the two-month total into a monthly average, so the
-- < 5 GB/month threshold matches the symptom table above.
SELECT
  line_item_resource_id AS nat_id,
  line_item_availability_zone AS az,
  SUM(CASE WHEN line_item_usage_type LIKE '%NatGateway-Hours' THEN line_item_usage_amount END) AS hours,
  COALESCE(SUM(CASE WHEN line_item_usage_type LIKE '%NatGateway-Bytes' THEN line_item_usage_amount END), 0) / 2 AS gb_per_month,
  ROUND(SUM(line_item_unblended_cost), 2) AS cost_period
FROM cur2
WHERE line_item_usage_start_date >= date_trunc('month', current_date - interval '2' month)
  AND line_item_usage_start_date <  date_trunc('month', current_date)
  AND product_servicecode = 'AmazonEC2'
  AND line_item_usage_type LIKE '%NatGateway%'
GROUP BY 1, 2
-- Two things the HAVING clause has to get right. Athena (Presto / Trino)
-- does not resolve SELECT aliases in HAVING, so the expression is repeated
-- in full. And COALESCE matters: a NAT with literally zero traffic produces
-- no NatGateway-Bytes line items at all, so the bare SUM returns NULL and
-- NULL < 5 filters out exactly the clearest zombies.
HAVING COALESCE(SUM(CASE WHEN line_item_usage_type LIKE '%NatGateway-Bytes' THEN line_item_usage_amount END), 0) / 2 < 5
ORDER BY cost_period DESC;
```

### Fix sequence

1. **Confirm both signals** are positive over the full observation window
   (the first signal could be temporary).
2. **Check for downstream dependencies**: route tables for NAT Gateways,
   DNS for load balancers, Lambda triggers for log groups.
3. **Owner notification with deadline**: idle resources are more likely
   than orphans to have a "but I might need it next week" defender.
4. **Decommission with rollback**: stopped instances can be deleted; NAT
   Gateways can be recreated in minutes; load balancers can be redeployed
   from IaC.
5. **For NAT specifically: consider VPC Endpoints as substitute** -
   gateway endpoints (S3, DynamoDB) are free; interface endpoints scale
   better than NAT for high-volume internal SaaS traffic.

### Anti-patterns

- **Single-metric detection**. CPU = 0 alone catches DR-standby instances.
  Always require two signals.
- **Deleting NAT without route-table review**. Cuts off management
  traffic; orphans the resources downstream.
- **Treating "stopped EC2" as cost-free**. EBS volumes attached to
  stopped instances continue to bill at full rate.

---

## Category 3: Overprovisioned resources

### Pattern shape

Resource is doing useful work but at a fraction of its allocated capacity.
Right-sizing reduces cost without functional change.

### Common patterns

| Pattern | Signal | Detection approach |
|---|---|---|
| EC2 with consistently low CPU | p95 CPU < 30% over 14 days, no memory pressure | CloudWatch + Compute Optimizer cross-reference |
| EBS on suboptimal type | gp2 → gp3 (always cheaper, equal perf), io1/io2 with low IOPS | EBS inventory + IOPS observation |
| RDS with low CPU and connections | CPU < 25% AND connections << max | CloudWatch RDS metrics |
| S3 bucket > 100 GB without lifecycle / Intelligent-Tiering | Bucket size > 100 GB, no lifecycle, no IT enabled | S3 metadata query |
| S3 versioning without noncurrent expiration | Versioning ON, no rule to expire noncurrent versions | S3 lifecycle inspection |
| CloudWatch Log Groups without retention | `RetentionInDays = null` (i.e. infinite) | Log Group metadata |
| DynamoDB provisioned without autoscaling | Provisioned billing mode, no autoscaling target | DDB metadata |
| Fargate services at fixed task count | No autoscaling configured | ECS service inspection |
| Redundant CloudTrail trails | Multiple trails recording same events in same account/region | CloudTrail trail enumeration |

### Detection example (EBS gp2 → gp3 migration candidates)

```sql
SELECT
  ResourceId,
  Region,
  Tags['team'] AS team,
  EffectiveCost AS gp2_monthly_cost,
  -- gp3 base price + IOPS + throughput vs gp2 base price
  -- gp3 is ~20% cheaper than gp2 for equivalent specs in most regions
  EffectiveCost * 0.8 AS estimated_gp3_cost,
  EffectiveCost * 0.2 AS estimated_monthly_savings
FROM focus_data
WHERE ServiceCategory = 'Storage'
  AND ResourceType = 'EBS Volume'
  AND Tags['volume_type'] = 'gp2'  -- mapping from provider tag
  AND ChargeClass IS NULL
  AND ChargePeriodStart >= current_date - interval '30' day
ORDER BY estimated_monthly_savings DESC;
```

### Fix sequence

1. **Right-sizing recommendations from multiple sources**: AWS Compute
   Optimizer, native CloudWatch percentiles, and the WasteLine appliance
   all generate recommendations - cross-reference for confidence.
2. **Stage rollouts**: dev → staging → prod canary → prod, with one week
   monitoring per stage. Right-sizing too aggressively causes throttling
   or OOMKills that destroy trust in the recommendation pipeline.
3. **Memory headroom matters**. CPU is the easy metric; memory regressions
   are catastrophic. For workloads where memory is the constraint, default
   to a 30% margin above p99.
4. **Document the recommendation rationale**. The owner needs to be able
   to defend the change in their sprint review. "Compute Optimizer
   recommended this" is enough; "we just thought it was high" is not.
5. **Track realised savings per recommendation**. Some recommendations
   will fail in production and get reverted - the savings number must
   reflect what stuck, not what was proposed.

### Anti-patterns

- **Bulk right-sizing in one pass**. Blast radius is the entire
  optimisation programme's credibility.
- **CPU-only sizing recommendations**. Memory regressions cause OOMs;
  network regressions cause throttling that masquerades as application
  bugs.
- **Right-sizing immediately after a major workload change** (deployment,
  feature launch, traffic event). Wait 14+ days for the new baseline to
  stabilise.
- **Ignoring volume-type modernisation**. gp2 → gp3 is the cheapest
  optimisation in most accounts; there is rarely a reason not to do it.

---

## Category 4: Commitment mismatches

### Pattern shape

Reserved Instances, Savings Plans, or Committed Use Discounts that are
underutilised, expiring soon, locked to the wrong configuration, or
missing where eligible spend would benefit. Provider-specific commitment
mechanics live in `finops-aws-commitments.md`,
`finops-azure-commitments.md`, `finops-gcp.md`.

### Common patterns

| Pattern | Signal | Detection approach |
|---|---|---|
| RI utilisation < 80% | `Utilization` metric below threshold over 30 days | Cost Explorer Reservations utilisation |
| RI approaching expiration | `ExpirationDate < 60 days from now` | Reservation inventory + expiration sort |
| Savings Plan utilisation < 80% | Cost Explorer Savings Plans utilisation report | SP utilisation query |
| Eligible spend not covered by SP | On-demand spend in regions/families that an SP would cover | Coverage gap analysis |
| ElastiCache without reserved coverage | Long-running clusters, no reserved nodes | ElastiCache + Reservations cross-reference |

### Detection example (RI utilisation gap)

```sql
SELECT
  reservation_id,
  instance_type,
  region,
  scope,
  expiration_date,
  utilization_pct,
  effective_hourly_cost,
  -- Wasted hours = total hours - utilised hours
  (1 - utilization_pct) * 730 AS wasted_hours_per_month,
  (1 - utilization_pct) * 730 * effective_hourly_cost AS wasted_dollars_per_month
FROM ri_utilization_report
WHERE utilization_pct < 0.80
  AND DATEDIFF('day', current_date, expiration_date) > 30  -- exclude near-expiry
ORDER BY wasted_dollars_per_month DESC;
```

### Fix sequence

1. **Distinguish underutilised from expiring**: underutilised commitments
   may be modifiable (RI exchange / modify); expiring commitments need a
   renewal decision.
2. **Modify before recommending new purchases**: the AWS / Azure / GCP
   liquidity rules described in the per-cloud files allow exchange or
   modification of existing commitments. Use them before adding more.
3. **Quarterly reassessment cadence**: commitment portfolio review is a
   quarterly cycle, not a one-off optimisation.
4. **Coverage gap analysis**: for stable spend not covered by an SP, build
   a tranche purchase recommendation - never a single large commitment.

See `finops-aws-commitments.md`, `finops-azure-commitments.md`,
`finops-gcp.md` for the provider-specific commitment portfolio strategies.

### Anti-patterns

- **Letting RIs expire without a decision**. The default behaviour is
  "do nothing"; the right behaviour is "renew, modify, or let expire
  intentionally". Expiry calendar surfaced 90 days in advance.
- **Recommending new commitments while existing commitments are
  underutilised**. Always modify or exchange first.
- **100% coverage targets**. Always silent waste - see
  `finops-aws-commitments.md` on portfolio liquidity.

---

## Category 5: Schedule blindness

### Pattern shape

Workload runs 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, but only does meaningful
work during business hours. Dev, test, and staging environments are the
classic case. Some production workloads (batch processing, weekly
reporting jobs) also fit.

The quickest confirmation is the flat-Sunday signature: pull the
resource's hourly usage curve for a Sunday and a Tuesday, and if the two
are indistinguishable, nobody is switching this workload off - schedules,
not sizing, are the fix.

### Common patterns

| Pattern | Signal | Detection approach |
|---|---|---|
| EC2 with clear business-hours pattern | High utilisation 9am-6pm weekdays, near-zero rest of time | CloudWatch CPU + network usage windowed analysis |
| Redshift cluster without pause/resume | Cluster running 24/7, low overnight CPU | CloudWatch Redshift metrics + scheduling metadata |

### Fix sequence

1. **Identify the schedule pattern from observed usage**, not from
   assumed business hours. Some teams really do work weekends or split
   shifts.
2. **Pilot on dev/test environments first**. Production scheduling has
   complications (long-running batch jobs, cross-time-zone teams) that
   dev does not.
3. **Tag-driven scheduling pattern**: workloads tag themselves with the
   schedule they support (`schedule=business-hours`, `schedule=24x7`,
   `schedule=batch-overnight`). Scheduler reads tags. New workloads
   default to a tag that requires explicit opt-out from scheduling.
4. **Realised savings**: 60-70% on dev / test that moves to business
   hours; 30-40% on production batch workloads that pause overnight.

### Anti-patterns

- **Scheduling production without owner sign-off**. Production downtime
  windows need explicit approval from the workload owner; never inferred.
- **Hard-coding schedules in IaC without tag indirection**. Hard-coded
  schedules drift; tag-driven scheduling adapts to workload changes.

---

## Category 6: Modernization opportunities

### Pattern shape

Workload runs on older-generation instance families, x86_64 architectures
where ARM (Graviton) equivalents exist, or services on AWS Extended
Support pricing. Modernization typically delivers 10-40% savings with low
operational risk if the workload supports the target architecture.

### Common patterns

| Pattern | Signal | Detection approach |
|---|---|---|
| EC2 on older generation | Instance family in t2/m4/c4/r4/i3 (newer equivalents available) | EC2 inventory + family taxonomy |
| x86_64 with Graviton equivalent | Instance family has a Graviton variant | EC2 inventory + Graviton mapping table |
| io1 EBS migrable to io2 | io1 volumes (io2 is same price, better durability) | EBS inventory by type |
| RDS on older instance class | RDS family is db.t2 / db.m4 / db.r4 / etc. | RDS inventory |
| RDS on Extended Support | Engine version flagged as Extended Support (paid surcharge) | RDS engine version + AWS pricing |
| Lambda x86_64 with ARM64 available | Lambda runtime supports both architectures | Lambda function inventory |
| Fargate task definition x86_64 | Task definition lists x86_64 architecture | Fargate inventory |

### Fix sequence

1. **Validate the workload supports the target architecture**: most
   stateless workloads do; some with native compiled dependencies do not.
2. **Test in lower environment first**: deploy on the new architecture
   in dev, run integration tests, confirm performance is equivalent.
3. **Stage the migration**: production canary (5-10% of traffic), then
   25%, 50%, 100%. Each stage held for 48-72 hours with metrics monitored.
4. **Have a rollback plan**: blue-green deployment or feature flag that
   reverts to the old architecture if metrics regress.
5. **Track realised savings against the new instance type cost**. ARM
   typically delivers 20-30% savings on equivalent workloads; older →
   newer generation typically 15-25%.

### Anti-patterns

- **Bulk migrating production without validation**. Some workloads have
  ARM-incompatible dependencies (legacy compiled binaries, older Java
  versions, some database drivers). Validation in staging is mandatory.
- **Treating modernization as one-time work**. New instance generations
  ship every 12-18 months. Modernization is a continuous process, not
  a project.
- **Ignoring Extended Support charges**. RDS Extended Support pricing is
  significant (typically 2-3x the base rate); migration to a supported
  version is usually the highest-ROI single optimisation in an account.

---

## Category 7: AI / ML inefficiency

### Pattern shape

AI workloads (SageMaker, Bedrock, GPU-instance training) generate waste
patterns that traditional FinOps tooling does not catch. Idle endpoints,
unused notebook instances, training jobs on-demand instead of Spot, and
provisioned throughput locked to the wrong model version are the
high-frequency patterns.

For broader AI cost-management discipline (token economics, agentic
patterns, ROI frameworks), see `finops-for-ai.md`,
`finops-ai-value-management.md`, `finops-genai-capacity.md`. For
provider-specific AI billing, see `finops-bedrock.md`,
`finops-azure-openai.md`, `finops-vertexai.md`, `finops-anthropic.md`.

### Common patterns

| Pattern | Signal | Detection approach |
|---|---|---|
| Bedrock Provisioned Throughput underutilised | p95 utilisation < 80% over 14 days | CloudWatch Bedrock utilisation |
| Bedrock PT locked to superseded model | Model version is older than the current generally-available equivalent | Bedrock inventory + model version mapping |
| Orphaned custom Bedrock models | Custom or imported model with zero invocations | Bedrock model inventory + invocation history |
| Bedrock on-demand in short bursts | Usage concentrated in short windows that batch-inference would handle | Invocation pattern analysis |
| Top-tier Bedrock model concentration | High share of tokens going to the most expensive model | Token-by-model breakdown (a conversation starter, not a hard rule) |
| Idle SageMaker notebook instances ([aws-sagemaker-notebook-always-on](../playbooks/aws-sagemaker-notebook-always-on.md)) | Notebook running, no kernel activity over 7 days | SageMaker inventory + activity check |
| Idle SageMaker endpoints ([aws-sagemaker-idle-endpoint](../playbooks/aws-sagemaker-idle-endpoint.md)) | Endpoint deployed, zero invocations over 30 days | CloudWatch SageMaker invocation metrics |
| Stale SageMaker Studio apps | Studio app running > 24 hours without user activity | Studio app metadata |
| Training jobs on-demand instead of Spot | SageMaker training job uses on-demand instances; checkpointing supported | SageMaker training job inventory |
| SageMaker endpoint sprawl ([aws-sagemaker-mme-consolidation](../playbooks/aws-sagemaker-mme-consolidation.md)) | 3+ lightly-used endpoints in same account/region, each on dedicated instance | Endpoint inventory grouped by account/region + invocation rates |
| Oversized GPU instance ([aws-gpu-instance-oversized](../playbooks/aws-gpu-instance-oversized.md)) | `DCGM_FI_PROF_GR_ENGINE_ACTIVE` < 20% AND `DCGM_FI_DEV_FB_USED` < 40% over 14 days | DCGM Exporter telemetry (CloudWatch `GPUUtilization` is misleading - see `finops-for-ai.md`) |
| Multi-GPU instance running single-GPU workload ([aws-multi-gpu-underutilized](../playbooks/aws-multi-gpu-underutilized.md)) | 7 of 8 GPUs near-zero utilisation on a multi-GPU instance | Per-GPU DCGM telemetry; CloudWatch does not expose per-device breakdown |
| GPU partition (MIG) candidate ([aws-mig-candidate](../playbooks/aws-mig-candidate.md)) | A100/H100 workload using < 1/7 of compute AND < 10 GB frame buffer | DCGM `DCGM_FI_PROF_GR_ENGINE_ACTIVE` + `DCGM_FI_DEV_FB_USED` |
| GPU instance for CPU-bound workload ([aws-gpu-for-cpu-bound-workload](../playbooks/aws-gpu-for-cpu-bound-workload.md)) | GPU idle (`GR_ENGINE_ACTIVE` < 5%) while CPU saturated (> 60%) | DCGM + CloudWatch `CPUUtilization` |
| Outdated GPU generation ([aws-outdated-gpu-generation](../playbooks/aws-outdated-gpu-generation.md)) | Significant hours on P3/G4dn while workload is compatible with G5/G6/P4d/P5 | CUR `product_instance_type` filter + workload framework check |

### Fix sequence

1. **Idle endpoints / notebooks: stop, do not delete**. Stopped resources
   can be restarted; deleted ones lose state. Notify owner with a 30-day
   stop-vs-delete decision window.
2. **Bedrock Provisioned Throughput underutilised**: switch to on-demand
   if the utilisation pattern is genuinely low; or right-size the PT
   commitment to the observed p95.
3. **Training on-demand → Spot**: validate the training job supports
   checkpointing (most modern training frameworks do). Spot delivers
   60-70% savings on long-running training jobs.
4. **Model version modernisation**: PT locked to a superseded model
   often costs more than the current equivalent. Migration requires
   the application team to validate the new model's behaviour; budget
   for the validation cycle.

### Anti-patterns

- **Treating AI workloads as standard EC2 cost-optimisation targets**.
  The AI cost surface is different - token economics, model selection,
  inference batching all matter more than instance rightsizing.
- **Aggressive idle-endpoint deletion**. SageMaker endpoints are often
  paused intentionally during product cycles; stop is safer than delete.
- **PT decisions made without product-team context**. Provisioned
  Throughput commitments are tied to product roadmap; FinOps cannot
  decide unilaterally to switch off.

---

## Category 8: Egress / data transfer

### Pattern shape

Every provider bills traffic for crossing a boundary: between Availability
Zones, between regions, out of the VPC, or out to the internet. The waste is
not the traffic itself - it is traffic crossing a boundary the architecture
never needed it to cross. A service mesh that gossips across AZs, a Kafka
cluster replicating across AZs at full throughput, a workload reaching S3
over a NAT Gateway instead of a VPC Endpoint: each is paying a per-GB toll
for a boundary crossing that a routing or placement decision could remove.

This category is structurally different from the other seven. The others are
about a resource that is wrong (absent workload, wrong size, wrong
commitment). Here the resources are all correct and it is the **path between
them** that costs money. That has three consequences:

- **Attribution is the hard part, not detection.** The bill tells you cross-AZ
  transfer cost $40K last month; it does not tell you which two services are
  talking. Flow logs plus workload mapping are the prerequisite.
- **The fix is usually architectural.** Topology-aware routing, co-location,
  in-AZ read replicas, VPC Endpoints - these are engineering changes with
  design trade-offs, not settings to toggle.
- **It hides inside other services' line items.** Cross-AZ traffic bills
  against EC2, not against a "networking" service, so it is invisible in a
  service-level cost breakdown. Only usage-type-level analysis surfaces it.

Egress is also the category most likely to be misdiagnosed as an availability
problem. A team that "fixes" cross-AZ cost by collapsing to a single AZ has
traded a recurring bill for an outage risk - see the anti-patterns below.

### Common patterns

| Pattern | Signal | Detection approach |
|---|---|---|
| Cross-AZ chatter ([aws-cross-az-egress](../playbooks/aws-cross-az-egress.md)) | `DataTransfer-Regional-Bytes` in the top 5 usage types for an account | CUR usage-type breakdown, then VPC Flow Logs for source / destination attribution |
| NAT Gateway used for AWS-service traffic | High NAT processing charges alongside heavy S3 / DynamoDB / ECR usage in the same VPC | NAT Gateway `BytesOutToDestination` vs VPC Endpoint inventory |
| Zombie NAT Gateway ([aws-zombie-nat-gateway](../playbooks/aws-zombie-nat-gateway.md)) | NAT Gateway with near-zero processed bytes but full hourly charge | CloudWatch NAT Gateway metrics + route table inspection |
| Public IPv4 footprint | Charge for every public IPv4 address since February 2024, attached or not | EIP and ENI inventory vs actual internet-facing requirement |
| Inter-region replication beyond requirement | Cross-region transfer for data whose RPO does not justify continuous replication | Transfer cost by region pair vs stated DR requirement |
| Internet egress that belongs behind a CDN | High direct-to-internet transfer for cacheable content | Transfer cost by service vs CDN hit rate |
| Cross-VPC / peering chatter | Peering or Transit Gateway processing charges between VPCs that could share a subnet | TGW / peering metrics + workload placement map |

Azure and GCP carry the same shape with different names and different
boundary pricing - see the networking-cost sections of `finops-azure.md`
and `finops-gcp.md`. GCP in particular prices some inter-zone traffic
differently from AWS, so do not port an AWS threshold across providers.

### Fix sequence

1. **Attribute before proposing.** Get from "cross-AZ costs $X" to "services
   A and B account for 70% of it". Without this, every recommendation is a
   guess and engineering will treat it as one.
2. **Take the free wins first.** VPC Endpoints for AWS-service traffic and
   releasing unneeded public IPv4 addresses are configuration changes with
   no architectural trade-off. Do these before proposing anything that
   touches placement.
3. **Then topology-aware routing.** Kubernetes Topology Aware Hints, Istio
   locality routing, target-group stickiness. Low risk, meaningful effect on
   chatty service pairs.
4. **Then placement changes.** Co-locating chatty pairs and adding in-AZ read
   replicas trade availability posture or instance cost against transfer
   cost. These need the workload owner in the room, with the trade-off named
   explicitly.
5. **Re-measure after each step.** Egress fixes interact - a VPC Endpoint can
   remove traffic that made a service pair look chatty, invalidating the case
   for moving it.

### Anti-patterns

- **Collapsing to a single AZ to eliminate cross-AZ cost.** The first AZ
  outage costs more than years of transfer charges. This is the defining
  failure mode of the category.
- **Proposing egress fixes without attribution.** "Reduce your cross-AZ
  traffic" is not a recommendation, it is a restatement of the bill.
- **Treating egress as a hygiene task.** Unlike orphaned resources, there is
  rarely a clearly-wrong resource to delete. Egress work needs engineering
  time budgeted, not a cleanup ticket.
- **Porting thresholds across providers.** Per-GB boundary pricing differs
  by provider and by boundary type; an AWS cross-AZ rule of thumb does not
  transfer to Azure or GCP.

## Operational tooling

OptimNow's WasteLine appliance is the operational tool for this
discipline on AWS. It implements Categories 1-7 above as 49
deterministic detection rules, with read-only AWS access, classification
confidence per finding, executive reporting, and proposal-only remediation
artifacts (CLI scripts, Terraform snippets, OpenOps workflows).

**Category 8 (egress) is doctrine, not tooling.** WasteLine does not ship
egress detection rules. Egress waste is attributed from flow logs and
usage-type analysis rather than from resource-state inspection, which is a
different data pipeline to the one the appliance runs. Treat egress findings
as manual analysis for now - CUR usage-type breakdown first, VPC Flow Logs
for attribution second.

What WasteLine adds beyond a manual hunt:

- **Deterministic, repeatable detection**: same scan run twice produces
  the same findings. Drift between human auditors is eliminated.
- **Region-aware pricing**: bundled pricing snapshot covering the major
  EC2 / RDS / ELB / NAT types across 12 regions
- **CUR integration**: replaces on-demand price estimates with actual
  amortised costs from the customer's CUR via Athena
- **AWS-native ingestion**: imports Cost Optimization Hub and Compute
  Optimizer recommendations and deduplicates with WasteLine's own
  findings
- **Multi-account / multi-tenant**: scheduled Fargate scans with S3
  history, dashboard with executive view
- **Anonymised MCP server**: AI agents can query the findings without
  the underlying scan data being exposed - resource IDs, ARNs, account
  IDs, and tags are stripped at the MCP boundary

For Azure and GCP waste detection, the cloud-specific catalogues in
`finops-azure-patterns.md` and `finops-gcp.md` cover the same waste taxonomy
applied to those providers. WasteLine extension to Azure and GCP is on the
roadmap.

## Crawl / Walk / Run progression

### Crawl - manual hunt

- Quarterly hunt across the eight categories using native AWS tooling
  (Cost Explorer, Compute Optimizer, Trusted Advisor) plus per-cloud
  Azure / GCP equivalents
- Manual two-signal classification with spreadsheet tracking
- Owner notification via email or Slack with manual deadline tracking
- Realised savings tracked monthly per resource ID

### Walk - tool-assisted hunt

- WasteLine deployed against AWS estate (or equivalent automation for
  Azure / GCP) running monthly
- Findings routed into team Slack channels with classification
  confidence
- Tag-driven aging policies for orphaned and idle resources (Joe Daly
  pattern: tag with date, snapshot + terminate after configured grace
  period, opt-out via tag)
- Lifecycle policies for snapshots, logs, S3 storage classes
- Quarterly waste-reduction KPI tracked alongside other FinOps metrics

### Run - continuous detection

- WasteLine on scheduled Fargate scans across all accounts; results
  persisted to S3 history
- Continuous waste detection feeding directly into the team's existing
  workflows (PR cost annotations, Slack notifications, JIRA tickets)
- Automated decommission for the obvious tier (orphaned snapshots past
  the grace period, unattached EBS volumes past 30 days untagged)
- Likely tier still requires owner ack; possible tier always requires
  human review
- Realised savings tracked as a continuous KPI; waste is a metric that
  trends down quarter-over-quarter

## Anti-patterns (across all categories)

- **Single-metric detection** producing false positives that erode trust
- **Bulk delete based on one signal**. Always require two signals and
  classify confidence
- **Reporting "potential savings"**. Stakeholders learn to discount these.
  Track realised savings only.
- **Skipping owner notification for "obvious" waste**. Even obvious
  orphans can be load-bearing in unexpected ways.
- **Treating waste detection as a one-time project**. Cloud waste
  regenerates as workloads change. Continuous detection is the only
  durable answer.
- **Aggressive deletion before snapshot or rollback path is in place**.
  Customer-critical data loss is career-ending.
- **No realised-savings tracking**. Without the closing-the-loop
  measurement, the programme has no signal of its own effectiveness and
  no defence against the inevitable "are we sure this is working?"
  conversation.
