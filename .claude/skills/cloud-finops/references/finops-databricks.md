## The data-platform FinOps problem

For Databricks (and Microsoft Fabric, see `finops-fabric.md` for the parallel
treatment), the cost object the platform reports - workspace, capacity, DBU hours,
query execution, capacity unit consumption - is rarely the same as the business
object Finance wants to allocate against (application, product, team, business unit,
data domain, use case). A shared workspace or shared Fabric capacity does not
naturally tell Finance who consumed what. The FinOps model needs a translation
layer between platform telemetry and business ownership. **Build the model around
the consumption driver, then reconcile it back to the invoice - not the other way
around.**

This framing is shared with `finops-fabric.md`. The mechanics differ between the two
platforms; the allocation problem is the same.

---

## Cost data foundations on Databricks

Databricks cost data lives primarily in **system tables** in Unity Catalog. Account-
admin queries against these tables are the canonical FinOps source of truth - cluster
UI snapshots, dashboards, and per-workspace reports all derive from the same data.
Skip the UI for serious analytics; query the system tables directly.

**FOCUS support:** As of December 2024, Databricks supports FOCUS v1.0 for
standardised cost data export, enabling cross-cloud normalisation with other
FOCUS-compliant providers (AWS v1.2, Azure v1.2, GCP v1.0). This simplifies
multi-cloud FinOps implementations by providing a common schema for cost allocation
and analysis across platforms.

### `system.billing.usage` - the canonical billing table

The single most important table for Databricks FinOps. One row per usage record
(typically 1-hour granularity), with fields covering account, workspace, SKU, DBUs
consumed, list-price USD, and identifiers for the workload that consumed the DBUs
(`usage_metadata` includes job_id, cluster_id, warehouse_id, endpoint_id depending
on workload type).

**Practical usage patterns:**
- Daily allocation by team / tag / project: join `usage_metadata.tags` to a team
  mapping; aggregate `usage_quantity` (DBUs) and `usage_quantity * list_price` (USD).
- Job-level cost trending: filter by `billing_origin_product = 'JOBS'` and join to
  `system.lakeflow.jobs` for job names.
- Anomaly detection: month-over-month delta per workspace per SKU, flagged at >20%.

**Important nuances:**
- Data is account-level (not workspace-level) - all workspaces under one account
  show up in the same table, controlled by `account_id`.
- List-price USD is the published price, not the customer's negotiated rate. For
  effective cost, multiply by your contract discount or join to `system.billing.list_prices`
  for historical price rate-card.
- Usage records appear with a typical 24-48 hour lag; do not use this for real-time
  alerting (use cluster-level metrics for that).

### Budget policies - programmatic spend governance

Budget policies are Databricks' first-class spend-control primitive (GA 2025). Define
a policy that attaches to compute (cluster, job, warehouse, serverless endpoint) and
enforces a spend cap with alert and/or hard-stop modes.

**What budget policies enable:**
- **Serverless serverless cost attribution before the fact** - tag the workload with
  the policy ID, and all serverless DBU consumption rolls up to that policy in
  billing reports (this is the canonical way to attribute serverless spend, since
  serverless workloads don't expose node-level visibility).
- **Spend caps with alerts** at configurable thresholds (e.g. 50%, 80%, 100%).
- **Hard-stop enforcement** for non-production policies - workload terminates when
  the cap is reached.
- **Workspace or account scope** - policies can be enforced org-wide or per-workspace.

**FinOps integration pattern:** create one budget policy per team or per cost-centre,
require all serverless workloads to declare a policy at submission time, and
reconcile against `system.billing.usage` monthly. This converts serverless from an
attribution-blind cost into a per-team accountable line item.

Source: https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/admin/usage/budget-policies

### Serverless attribution - what changes vs classic compute

Serverless compute (SQL Warehouses serverless, Jobs serverless, Model Serving)
differs from classic compute in two FinOps-relevant ways:

1. **No node-level visibility.** You don't see the underlying VMs - Databricks
   manages capacity and charges per DBU consumed. Cluster-level monitoring
   patterns (autoscaler tuning, node pool selection) don't apply.
2. **Attribution flows through workload IDs and budget policies, not cluster tags.**
   Tag the *workload* (job, warehouse, endpoint) or attach a budget policy; the tag
   propagates to `system.billing.usage` via `usage_metadata`.

The serverless billing system table - `system.billing.usage` filtered to serverless
SKUs, plus the more detailed serverless-specific tables - is the right starting
point for serverless cost analysis. Don't try to back-derive cost from query
duration; let the billing system tell you what it cost.

Source: https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/admin/system-tables/serverless-billing

### Model serving attribution

Databricks Model Serving (foundation model APIs and custom-deployed models) bills
through dedicated meters that show up in `system.billing.usage` with
`billing_origin_product = 'MODEL_SERVING'` and per-endpoint identifiers in
`usage_metadata`.

**Two distinct cost categories within model serving:**
- **Provisioned throughput** - dedicated capacity for production endpoints, billed
  per DBU-hour regardless of request volume. Right-size against P95 throughput.
- **Pay-per-token** - token-based billing for foundation model APIs (Llama, Mixtral,
  etc. served by Databricks). Billed per 1k input/output tokens.

**Per-endpoint attribution pattern:** require all model-serving endpoints to carry
a `cost_centre` and `application` tag at deployment. Aggregate from
`system.billing.usage` weekly to surface high-cost endpoints and re-evaluate
provisioned-throughput sizing for ones consistently below 50% utilisation.

## Compute Optimization Patterns (15)

**Inefficient Query Design In Databricks Sql And Spark Jobs**
Service: Databricks SQL | Type: Inefficient Configuration

Many Spark and SQL workloads in Databricks suffer from micro-optimization issues - such as unfiltered joins, unnecessary shuffles, missing broadcast joins, and repeated scans of uncached data. These problems increase compute time and resource utilization, especially in exploratory or development environments.

- Enable Adaptive Query Execution to improve join strategies and reduce shuffle
- Use broadcast joins for small lookup tables where applicable
- Apply filtering and predicate pushdown early in the query

**Inefficient Use Of Photon Engine In Databricks Compute**
Service: Databricks Clusters | Type: Inefficient Configuration

Photon is enabled by default on many Databricks compute configurations. While it can accelerate certain SQL and DataFrame operations, its performance benefits are workload-specific and may not justify the increased DBU cost.

- Update default compute configurations to disable Photon for general-purpose or low-complexity workloads
- Restrict users from enabling Photon unless justified by benchmarked performance gains
- Establish cluster policies or templates that exclude Photon by default and allow opt-in only under specific conditions

**Lack Of Workload Specific Cluster Segmentation**
Service: Databricks Compute | Type: Inefficient Configuration

Running varied workload types (e.g., ETL pipelines, ML training, SQL dashboards) on the same cluster introduces inefficiencies. Each workload has different runtime characteristics, scaling needs, and performance sensitivities.

- Define and enforce separate cluster types for distinct workload categories (e.g., SQL, ML, ETL)
- Encourage the use of job clusters for short-lived, batch-oriented workloads to ensure clean isolation and efficient resource use
- Use job clusters for single-purpose, short-lived jobs to ensure isolation and efficient spin-up

**Overuse Of Photon In Non Production Workloads**
Service: Databricks Compute | Type: Inefficient Configuration

Photon is frequently enabled by default across Databricks workspaces, including for development, testing, and low-concurrency workloads. In these non-production contexts, job runtimes are typically shorter, SLAs are relaxed or nonexistent, and performance gains offer little business value.

- Disable Photon by default in dev/test environments using workspace settings or cluster policies
- Create separate cluster templates or policies for production and non-production workloads
- Use tagging or automation to flag or block Photon usage in low-priority environments

**Poorly Configured Autoscaling On Databricks Clusters**
Service: Databricks Compute | Type: Inefficient Configuration

Autoscaling is a core mechanism for aligning compute supply with workload demand, yet it's often underutilized or misconfigured. In older clusters or ad-hoc environments, autoscaling may be disabled by default or set with tight min/max worker limits that prevent scaling.

- Use autoscaling for variable workloads, but avoid overly wide min/max ranges that allow clusters to over-expand. Databricks may aggressively scale up if limits are too high, leading to cost spikes and instability.
- For predictable, recurring jobs with stable compute requirements, consider using fixed-size clusters to avoid the cost and time of scaling transitions.
- Tune autoscaling thresholds based on real workload behavior. Start narrow and adjust iteratively, based on runtime performance and cluster utilization.

**Underuse Of Serverless For Short Or Interactive Workloads**
Service: Databricks SQL | Type: Inefficient Configuration

Many organizations continue running short-lived or low-intensity SQL workloads - such as dashboards, exploratory queries, and BI tool integrations - on traditional clusters. This leads to idle compute, overprovisioning, and high baseline costs, especially when the clusters are always-on.

- Migrate lightweight SQL workloads and dashboards to Databricks SQL Serverless
- Enable serverless for high-concurrency, low-compute scenarios where persistent compute isn’t needed
- Set policies or guidelines to default to serverless for interactive workloads unless specific performance reasons require otherwise

**Inefficient Bi Queries Driving Excessive Compute Usage**
Service: Interactive Clusters | Type: Inefficient Query Patterns

Business Intelligence dashboards and ad-hoc analyst queries frequently drive Databricks compute usage - especially when: * Dashboards are auto-refreshed too frequently * Queries scan full datasets instead of leveraging filtered views or materialized tables * Inefficient joins or large broadcast operations are used * Redundant or exploratory queries are triggered during interactive exploration This often results in clusters staying active for longer than necessary, or being autoscaled up to handle inefficient workloads, leading to unnecessary DBU consumption.

- Refactor BI queries to limit scan scope and reduce complexity
- Materialize frequently used intermediate results into temp or Delta tables
- Reduce auto-refresh frequency of dashboards unless real-time data is essential

**Inefficient Autotermination Configuration For Interactive Clusters**
Service: Databricks Clusters | Type: Misconfiguration

Interactive clusters are often left running between periods of active use. To mitigate idle charges, Databricks provides an “autotermination” setting that shuts down clusters after a period of inactivity.

- Lower the autotermination threshold for interactive clusters
- Apply workspace compute policies to cap the maximum idle time for clusters
- Grant exceptions only when use cases are documented and cost impact is understood

**Inefficient Use Of Interactive Clusters**
Service: Databricks Clusters | Type: Misconfiguration

Interactive clusters are intended for development and ad-hoc analysis, remaining active until manually terminated. When used to run scheduled jobs or production workflows, they often stay idle between executions -leading to unnecessary infrastructure and DBU costs.

- Reassign scheduled jobs to ephemeral job clusters
- Apply workspace policies to enforce job cluster usage for scheduled workflows
- Educate users on the differences between cluster modes and their appropriate use cases

**Missing Auto Termination Policy For Databricks Clusters**
Service: Databricks Clusters | Type: Missing Safeguard

In many environments, users launch Databricks clusters for development or analysis and forget to shut them down after use. When no auto-termination policy is configured, these clusters remain active indefinitely, incurring unnecessary charges for both Databricks and cloud infrastructure usage.

- Enable auto-termination for all clusters that do not require persistent runtime
- Set cluster policies to require auto-termination configuration for new clusters
- Establish reasonable inactivity thresholds based on workload type (e.g., 30-60 minutes for interactive)

**Oversized Worker Or Driver Nodes In Databricks Clusters**
Service: Databricks Clusters | Type: Overprovisioned Resource

Databricks users can select from a wide range of instance types for cluster driver and worker nodes. Without guardrails, teams may choose high-cost configurations (e.g., 16xlarge nodes) that exceed workload requirements.

- Define and enforce compute policies that restrict driver and worker node types to appropriate sizes
- Reconfigure existing clusters using oversized nodes to use smaller, cost-effective alternatives
- Allow exceptions only for workloads that demonstrably require high-performance nodes

**Underuse Of Serverless Compute For Jobs And Notebooks**
Service: Databricks Serverless Compute | Type: Suboptimal Execution Model

Databricks Serverless Compute is now available for jobs and notebooks, offering a simplified, autoscaled compute environment that eliminates cluster provisioning, reduces idle overhead, and improves Spot survivability. For short-running, bursty, or interactive workloads, Serverless can significantly reduce cost by billing only for execution time.

- Pilot Serverless for eligible workloads, such as short, periodic jobs or ad-hoc notebooks
- Use compute policies or templates to promote Serverless adoption where appropriate
- Retain traditional clusters for workloads with unsupported libraries or long-lived compute patterns

**Lack Of Graviton Usage In Databricks Clusters**
Service: Databricks Clusters | Type: Suboptimal Instance Selection

Databricks supports AWS Graviton-based instances for most workloads, including Spark jobs, data engineering pipelines, and interactive notebooks. These instances offer significant cost advantages over traditional x86-based VMs, with comparable or better performance in many cases.

- Monitor utilized instance types and recommend Graviton-based families
- Reconfigure default cluster templates to use Graviton by default
- Allow exceptions only for workloads with documented compatibility or performance issues

**On Demand Only Configuration For Non Production Databricks Clusters**
Service: Databricks Clusters | Type: Suboptimal Pricing Model

In non-production environments -such as development, testing, and experimentation -many teams default to on-demand nodes out of habit or caution. However, Databricks offers built-in support for using spot instances safely.

- Enable spot instance usage for non-production clusters where workloads are resilient to interruption
- Leverage Databricks’ native fallback-to-on-demand capabilities to preserve job continuity
- Establish workspace-level defaults or templates that promote spot usage in dev/test clusters

**Suboptimal Use Of On Demand Instances In Non Production Clusters**
Service: Databricks Clusters | Type: Suboptimal Pricing Model

In Databricks, on-demand instances provide reliable performance but come at a premium cost. For non-production workloads -such as development, testing, or exploratory analysis -high availability is often unnecessary.

- Implement compute policies that cap the percentage of on-demand nodes in relevant workloads
- Update existing cluster configurations to prioritize Spot usage for dev/test workloads
- Allow exceptions only when reliability or performance constraints are well documented

## Storage Optimization Patterns (1)

**Missing Delta Optimization Features For High Volume Tables**
Service: Delta Lake | Type: Suboptimal Data Layout

In many Databricks environments, large Delta tables are created without enabling standard optimization features like partitioning and Z-Ordering. Without these, queries scanning large datasets may read far more data than necessary, increasing execution time and compute usage.

- Apply partitioning when writing Delta tables, using columns commonly filtered in queries
- Enable Z-Ordering on appropriate columns to improve data skipping efficiency
- Use `OPTIMIZE` and `VACUUM` to reduce file fragmentation and improve query performance

---

## Other Optimization Patterns (2)

**Inefficient Use Of Job Clusters In Databricks Workflows**
Service: Databricks Workflows | Type: Suboptimal Cluster Configuration

When multiple tasks within a workflow are executed on separate job clusters - despite having similar compute requirements - organizations incur unnecessary overhead. Each cluster must initialize independently, adding latency and cost.

- Configure a shared job cluster to run multiple tasks within the same workflow when compute requirements are similar
- Leverage cluster reuse settings to reduce start-up overhead and improve efficiency
- Validate that consolidation does not impact workload performance or isolation requirements before implementing

**Lack Of Functional Cost Attribution In Databricks Workloads**
Service: Databricks | Type: Visibility Gap

Databricks cost optimization begins with visibility. Unlike traditional IaaS services, Databricks operates as an orchestration layer spanning compute, storage, and execution - but its billing data often lacks granularity by workload, job, or team.

- Orchestration (DBUs): Analyze query/job-level execution and optimize workload design
- Compute: Review underlying VM types and cost models (e.g., Spot, RI, Savings Plans)
- Storage: Align S3/ADLS/GCS usage with lifecycle policies and avoid excessive churn

---

## Allocation and Governance

The optimisation patterns above answer "where is the waste?" This section answers
"who pays?" - the harder problem on a shared data platform.

### Workspace-level reporting is necessary but not sufficient

Workspace cost alone is too coarse. A single workspace is shared across teams, jobs,
notebooks, pipelines, and experiments. Allocating only by workspace owner risks
charging the platform owner or default business unit, not the actual consumer.

A useful Databricks allocation model layers signals:

| Layer | Allocation signal | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| Workspace | name, owner, business mapping | First-level showback |
| Compute | cluster, job, pool usage | Identifies major technical cost drivers |
| Execution | query executor, job owner, notebook owner | Links cost to users or teams |
| Consumption | DBU hours | Core usage metric |
| Financial view | amortised vs PAYG cost | Shows savings from commitments |

The strongest single allocation pattern: **DBU hours by executor or workload,
translated into amortised cost.**

```sql
-- DBU hours by executor / job, joined to workspace metadata, last 30 days
-- Adjust to your account's system table location and tag conventions.
WITH usage_by_executor AS (
  SELECT
    workspace_id,
    coalesce(usage_metadata.job_id,
             usage_metadata.cluster_id,
             usage_metadata.warehouse_id,
             usage_metadata.endpoint_id) AS workload_id,
    coalesce(identity_metadata.run_as,
             usage_metadata.created_by) AS executor,
    sku_name,
    sum(usage_quantity) AS dbu_hours,
    sum(usage_quantity * list_price) AS list_usd
  FROM system.billing.usage
  LEFT JOIN system.billing.list_prices USING (sku_name, currency_code, usage_unit)
  WHERE usage_date >= current_date() - INTERVAL 30 DAY
  GROUP BY ALL
)
SELECT
  workspace_id,
  executor,
  workload_id,
  sku_name,
  round(sum(dbu_hours), 2) AS dbu_hours,
  round(sum(list_usd), 2) AS list_usd_30d
FROM usage_by_executor
GROUP BY ALL
ORDER BY list_usd_30d DESC
LIMIT 50;
```

The query is illustrative - your `system.billing.list_prices` schema and
identity-metadata fields may differ; adapt column names to your account.

### The Azure VM Reservation vs DBU clarification

**Common trap.** Databricks compute runs on Azure VMs, so **Azure VM Reservations
apply to the underlying VM compute layer**. But Databricks also charges a separate
**DBU meter** for the Databricks platform layer, billed independently. **Azure VM
RIs do not cover the DBU meter.**

- Azure VM RI -> covers the VM hourly charge.
- DBU meter -> covered by Databricks-specific commitments (DBCU, see below) or
  paid PAYG.

Customers coming from VM-only commitment thinking often assume an Azure RI on the
underlying VM family covers their Databricks bill. It covers half of it. Surface
both meters separately when modelling Databricks commitment economics.

### Databricks commitment instruments

- **DBCU (Databricks Commit Units)** - annual prepaid commitment to a $ amount of
  DBUs. Separate from Azure RIs and Savings Plans; negotiated with Databricks /
  Microsoft directly. Discount depth depends on commitment size and tier.
- **Photon multiplier** - Photon-enabled clusters consume DBUs at roughly 2x the
  base rate but execute 2-3x faster on supported workloads (vectorised SQL,
  certain DataFrame ops). Net cost can go down despite the multiplier; depends on
  workload. Validate per workload before defaulting Photon on or off org-wide.
- **Serverless premium** - Serverless SQL Warehouses, jobs, and notebooks consume
  DBUs at a higher rate (roughly 1.5-2x) than classic compute. Trade-off: no
  cluster management overhead, near-instant start, no idle cost. Worth it for
  spiky interactive work; not always worth it for steady-state heavy jobs.
- **DBU rates differ by workload type** - Jobs Compute is the cheapest tier,
  All-Purpose is the most expensive, SQL Warehouse sits between with tier-
  dependent rates. Migrating a scheduled job from All-Purpose to Jobs Compute is
  often a 30-40% saving with zero functional change. **Verify current rates
  against the Databricks Azure pricing page; do not hard-code.**

### Amortised vs PAYG visibility - splitting the conversation

A useful Databricks cost report shows **both amortised cost and PAYG-equivalent
cost.** This separates two distinct conversations:

- **Consumption conversation** - "Who used the platform, and how much?" - driven
  by DBU hours and PAYG-equivalent cost. The right view for showback to teams,
  capacity planning, and unit-economics work.
- **Commercial effectiveness conversation** - "How much did reservations or DBCU
  commitments reduce the effective rate?" - driven by amortised vs PAYG delta.
  The right view for finance to assess commitment ROI and for FinOps to track ESR
  (Effective Savings Rate).

Without this split, teams may believe their behaviour generated savings when the
savings actually came from centralised commitment purchasing, or the reverse - a
team that genuinely reduced consumption sees no impact in their amortised number
because the contractual amortisation is fixed.

### Monthly review cadence - Databricks side

| Review item | Source signal |
|---|---|
| Top cost drivers | DBU hours by workspace, job, user (from `system.billing.usage` joined to `system.lakeflow.jobs`) |
| Waste | Idle clusters, unused jobs, oversized clusters (cluster events + utilisation metrics) |
| Allocation gaps | Unmapped workspaces, missing executor labels, untagged workloads |
| Commitment status | DBCU utilisation, RI utilisation on underlying VMs, PAYG-equivalent vs amortised delta |
| Anomalies | DBU hour spikes, query activity spikes (>20% week-over-week threshold) |
| Actions | Tune jobs, remove clusters, fix labels, scope new commitments |

This feeds Finance, platform engineering, and data owners simultaneously - the
review is not three separate meetings.

### Sequencing - clean up before committing

Standard FinOps sequencing applies to Databricks specifically. Each step is a
prerequisite for the next:

1. Remove idle clusters and abandoned workspaces.
2. Right-size clusters that survive cleanup.
3. Migrate jobs from All-Purpose to Jobs Compute where appropriate (cheapest tier).
4. Establish baseline consumption over 60-90 days post-cleanup.
5. **Then** commit via DBCU and / or Azure VM RIs on the underlying compute.

**Reserving before cleanup turns waste into a contractual baseline.** This is the
single most expensive ordering mistake on Databricks engagements - DBCU commitments
are non-trivial and a year-long commitment to over-provisioned clusters is hard to
unwind.
