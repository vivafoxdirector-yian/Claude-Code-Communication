## Azure OpenAI Service billing model overview

Azure OpenAI Service (AOAI) provides access to OpenAI models (GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, GPT-5,
o-series reasoning models, DALL-E, Whisper, and others) through Azure's infrastructure.
It is separate from OpenAI's direct API - billing, compliance, and capacity management
are handled through Azure.

### Billing dimensions

| Dimension | Description |
|---|---|
| Input tokens | Tokens in the prompt, including system prompt and context |
| Output tokens | Tokens generated in the response |
| Cached input tokens | Input tokens served from prompt cache (discounted rate) |
| Model choice | Each model has its own per-token rate |
| Capacity model | Standard (PAYG) vs Provisioned Throughput Units (PTUs) |
| Fine-tuning | Training token charges + hosting charges for fine-tuned deployments |
| Image / audio | Billed in units (images per resolution, audio per second) - separate from tokens |

**Key cost driver:** output tokens are billed at 4-8x the input rate on current
Azure OpenAI models (GPT-4.1 at 4x, GPT-5 at 8x, as of August 2026). High
output-ratio workloads carry disproportionately higher costs, and the multiplier
matters more than the headline input rate when you size a workload.

### Deployment Locality

Deployment locality controls where data is processed and stored. The choice affects
performance, compliance posture, and cost.

| Locality option | Description | Cost vs. Global |
|---|---|---|
| **Global** | Traffic routed across regions for best availability and throughput | Lowest |
| **Data Zone (US or EU)** | Processing within all regions of a chosen zone (e.g., all EU regions) | Slightly higher |
| **Regional** | Processing and storage within a single Azure region (e.g., Germany, Australia) | Comparable to Data Zone for standard token rates; provisioned (PTU) hourly rates run materially higher - verify per model |

**Key trade-offs:**
- Global deployment offers the best performance and lowest cost but provides no data
  residency guarantees
- Data Zone deployment balances compliance and throughput - suited for EU data
  sovereignty requirements without the throughput penalty of single-region
- Regional deployment is the strictest option; suitable for regulated industries
  requiring single-region data residency, but performance is lower

Locality adds a cost premium beyond the base token rate. Always confirm your
compliance requirements before defaulting to a more restrictive (and more expensive)
locality option.

## Model pricing reference

### Standard (pay-as-you-go) pricing

Standard pricing is per-million tokens, billed per API call. No upfront commitment.

| Model | Relative cost tier | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| GPT-4o mini | Low | High-volume, cost-sensitive workloads |
| GPT-4.1 mini | Low | Lightweight tasks, classification |
| GPT-4o | Mid | General purpose, balanced capability/cost |
| GPT-4.1 | Mid | Updated GPT-4 generation |
| GPT-5 | High | Complex reasoning, frontier capability |
| o3-mini | Mid | Reasoning model, cost-optimised |
| o3 | High | Full reasoning model |

The rate *structure* is what to plan against - the multipliers below have been stable
while the absolute rates have not (structure as of August 2026):

| Model | Cached input vs standard input | Output vs standard input |
|---|---|---|
| GPT-5 | 0.1x (90% discount) | 8x |
| GPT-4.1 | 0.25x (75% discount) | 4x |

For the current absolute rates, use the Azure pricing documentation or a live pricing
tool (<https://optimtoken.optimnow.io>) rather than a figure remembered from this file.

### Provisioned vs standard pricing - hourly PTU vs reservation-discounted PTU

The PTU economics are model-specific and have **three distinct price points** to
keep separate:

1. **Standard (PAYG)** - per-token rate, no capacity commitment.
2. **Hourly PTU (no reservation)** - dedicated capacity priced per PTU-hour. This is
   the price comparison most often quoted; for some models, hourly PTU at 100%
   utilisation is more expensive than the equivalent PAYG token spend, which is why
   provisioned capacity at this price point is mainly a performance and SLA purchase.
3. **PTU + Reservation** - committing to PTU capacity for **1 month or 1 year**
   via an Azure reservation produces meaningful discounts off the hourly PTU rate
   (no 3-year PTU reservation exists, unlike classic Azure compute reservations).
   Microsoft's current docs frame reservations as "considerable discounts" on
   provisioned throughput, with many consistent workloads finding reserved PTU a
   better value than hourly PTU or PAYG.

**Practical implication:** "Is provisioned cheaper?" is the wrong framing. The right
framing is "Is PTU + reservation, at the customer's actual utilisation curve, cheaper
than PAYG?" Run the comparison against the reservation-discounted PTU rate, not the
hourly PTU rate, before concluding provisioned is uneconomic.

**Reservation locality constraint.** PTU reservations are purchased by **deployment
locality (Global / Data Zone / Regional)** and are **not exchangeable across
localities**. A Global PTU reservation cannot serve a Data Zone deployment. Before
purchasing, confirm which locality the deployment will use - the wrong locality
means the reservation is stranded.

## Provisioned Throughput Units (PTUs)

### How the PTU model works

Azure OpenAI Service - increasingly framed by Microsoft under the **Azure AI Foundry
/ Microsoft Foundry Models** umbrella - uses a **pool-based capacity model**. You
purchase a block of PTUs (hourly) or commit via reservation, then deploy models
against that capacity. PTUs are model-flexible at deploy time within the **same
locality** (Global / Data Zone / Regional), but **reservations are not exchangeable
across localities** - a Global PTU reservation cannot serve a Data Zone deployment
or vice versa. Lock in the locality before purchasing the reservation.

You then **deploy models against that pool**, assigning a number of PTUs to each deployment.
Different models have different PTU minimums to operate effectively, with larger models
requiring more PTUs.

**Example:**
- Reserve 500 PTUs
- Deploy: 100 PTUs → GPT-4o, 50 PTUs → GPT-4.1 mini
- Remaining 350 PTUs: unallocated (waste) unless assigned to additional deployments

### Key characteristics

- **Full model flexibility:** when a new model is released, retire the old deployment
  and reassign its PTUs to the new model - no new reservation required
- **Decoupled reservation and deployment:** a PTU reservation does not guarantee that
  model capacity will be available for your chosen model
- **Spillover available, but opt-in:** overflow traffic can route to a standard
  (PAYG) deployment instead of returning HTTP 429 - it must be configured
  (`spilloverDeploymentName` on the deployment, or the `x-ms-spillover-deployment`
  request header) and requires a matching standard deployment of the same
  model/version in the same resource
- **Two waste types:** idle allocated capacity (PTUs assigned but underutilised) and
  unallocated capacity (PTUs reserved but not assigned to any deployment)

### PTU deployment guidance from Azure

Azure recommends: **deploy models first, then make the reservation**. This validates
model availability before committing spend. For existing reservations, switching models
requires waiting for capacity availability, which can leave PTUs unallocated and paid
for during the wait.

### When PTUs make sense on Azure OpenAI

| Condition | Recommendation |
|---|---|
| Consistent 24/7 workload, latency-sensitive | Strong candidate |
| Frequent model updates expected | PTU flexibility is the key advantage here |
| Data privacy / PII requirement | Not a PTU differentiator - Azure excludes prompts/completions from foundation-model training on **all** deployment types, standard included. The PTU privacy argument is isolation and predictable latency, not training exclusion |
| Bursty traffic with spillover tolerance | Acceptable - spillover is available once configured |
| Cost reduction as primary goal | Caution - run the break-even against the reservation-discounted rate for your model and utilisation curve. Microsoft prices PTUs in $/PTU/hour only; any $/MTok "provisioned premium" figure you encounter is a derived estimate, not a published rate |

### PTU governance checklist

- [ ] Deploy models first - validate capacity availability before purchasing reservation
- [ ] Calculate break-even utilisation for each model (provisioned ÷ standard per-token rate)
- [ ] Load-test to validate effective throughput against your actual token mix
- [ ] Monitor unallocated PTUs - set alerts when PTUs are reserved but undeployed
- [ ] Monitor allocated PTU utilisation - target >80%
- [ ] Define spillover policy: what percentage of requests can route to PAYG within SLA?
- [ ] Set spending alerts on PAYG spillover costs (variable component of a provisioned setup)
- [ ] Apply existing Azure EA discounts - verify they apply to PTU reservations

---

## Spillover mechanics

Azure offers native spillover for GenAI capacity - as does GCP Vertex AI, where
Provisioned Throughput overage spills to pay-as-you-go **by default**. Azure's
spillover is opt-in: it must be configured per deployment.

Once configured, when provisioned capacity is fully utilised, overflow requests route
to the designated standard PAYG deployment. Spillover triggers not only on capacity
exhaustion (429) but also on long-context requests (400) and server errors (500/503).
No HTTP 429 errors are returned to callers unless both provisioned and PAYG capacity
are exhausted.

### Spillover cost implications

- Spillover requests are billed at standard PAYG rates - the variable component of your bill
- Spillover volume depends on traffic spikes relative to your PTU allocation
- Monitor spillover rate to determine whether PTU allocation needs adjustment

### Using spillover to right-size reservations

Spillover allows you to size PTU reservations for **average load**, not peak load.
This is equivalent to the Savings Plan / CUD approach in traditional cloud:
- Set a coverage target (e.g., 70-80% of requests served by PTUs)
- Let spillover handle peaks at PAYG rates
- Adjust PTU allocation over time as traffic patterns evolve

## Cost visibility and allocation

### Azure Cost Management integration

Azure OpenAI Service costs appear in Azure Cost Management under the
`Cognitive Services` or `Azure OpenAI` service namespace depending on resource type.

Key filtering dimensions:
- Resource name (OpenAI resource / deployment)
- Meter name (Standard tokens, PTU reservation, fine-tuning)
- Subscription / Resource Group
- Tags

**Limitation:** native Cost Management does not provide token-level granularity per
request. For unit economics, combine billing data with Azure Monitor metrics or
application-level instrumentation.

### Tagging strategy for Azure OpenAI

Azure OpenAI resources support standard Azure resource tags. Apply tags at the
resource level (not deployment level) for Cost Management attribution.

**Recommended allocation approach:**

| Allocation need | Method |
|---|---|
| Team / product attribution | Separate resource groups or subscriptions per team |
| Environment separation | Separate subscriptions (prod/dev/staging) |
| Workload-level unit economics | Application instrumentation + Azure Monitor |
| PTU allocation tracking | Deployment-level monitoring in Azure OpenAI Studio |

### Cost visibility limitation: account vs. deployment level

Azure OpenAI has two resource types: **accounts** (administrative units, analogous to
clusters) and **deployments** (individual model endpoints that applications call).
Configuration and usage live at the deployment level. Native billing aggregates costs
to the account level.

This creates a structural visibility gap:

- If multiple applications share one Azure OpenAI account, native billing cannot
  attribute costs by application - even if model deployments are separated
- Native Cost Management shows what was spent, but not which application or
  workflow drove the spend
- Without deployment-level or application-level attribution, optimisation and
  capacity planning remain reactive: teams discover inefficiency only after the
  bill arrives

**Implication for FinOps:** native Azure Cost Management data is necessary but not
sufficient for AI FinOps. Supplement it with Azure Monitor metrics and
application-level instrumentation (logging token counts per request, per feature,
per use case) to build the cost attribution layer that billing alone cannot provide.

**Allocation approaches, in order of rigor:**

1. Separate Azure OpenAI accounts per team or product (cleanest boundary)
2. Separate resource groups and subscriptions with mandatory tagging
3. Application-layer instrumentation logging token counts per request via Azure
   Monitor or custom middleware

For finer granularity - cost per user journey rather than per team - middleware logging
token counts and feature identifiers to Application Insights provides the additional layer.

**PTU unallocated capacity waste:** Provisioned Throughput Units are reserved at the
account level and allocated to deployments. Unallocated PTUs - reserved but not assigned
to any active deployment - generate cost with no associated output. Monitor PTU allocation
actively; this waste is invisible unless you build a dedicated utilisation view.

### Azure Monitor metrics for Azure OpenAI

| Metric | Use |
|---|---|
| `TokenTransaction` | Input/output token volume by model and deployment |
| `ProvisionedUtilizationRate` | PTU utilisation (target >80%) |
| `AzureOpenAIRequests` | Request volume |
| `SuccessfulRequests` | Baseline for error rate calculation |
| `RateLimitErrors` | Signals capacity exhaustion in PAYG or PTU |

## Cost optimisation patterns

### Optimisation levers framework

LLM cost optimisation operates across four distinct levers. Address them in order  -
rate is the least impactful lever in isolation; model interaction often delivers the
highest ROI for the effort.

| Lever | Description | Example actions |
|---|---|---|
| **Rate** | Baseline pricing for model usage | Commitment discounts (PTU reservations, EA terms) |
| **Infrastructure configuration** | Deployment parameters affecting cost without changing model behaviour | Right-sizing PTU allocation, adjusting rate limits, deployment locality choice |
| **Model selection** | Choice of model type and version | Switching GPT-4o → GPT-4o mini for eligible tasks; o1 → o3 for reasoning workloads |
| **Model interaction** | How applications engage the model | Prompt optimisation, context truncation, caching |

### Model right-sizing and modernisation

- Define a quality benchmark for your specific task before selecting a model
- Test GPT-4o mini / GPT-4.1 mini before defaulting to GPT-4o or GPT-5
- Reasoning models (o3-mini vs o3) have significant cost differences - benchmark both
- Use the lowest-cost model that meets your quality threshold
- **Model modernisation is an optimisation lever in its own right:** newer models within
  the same capability tier are often faster and cheaper than the models they replace.
  Replacing o1 with o3 can deliver up to 80-90% cost reduction on reasoning workloads.
  Treat model refresh as a recurring FinOps activity, not a one-time migration.
- Scan deployments periodically for outdated models - paying a higher per-token rate
  for a superseded model generation is pure waste

### Prompt caching

Azure OpenAI supports prompt caching. The cached-input discount is **model-dependent**,
not a flat rate: roughly 90% on GPT-5, 75% on
GPT-4.1, ~50% on GPT-4o, and up to 100% on Provisioned deployments. Newer model
generations may also charge for cache **writes** - check the per-model pricing page
rather than assuming reads-only billing. Effective for:
- Long, repeated system prompts
- RAG pipelines with consistent prefixes
- Multi-turn conversations with stable context

### Prompt optimisation

- Audit system prompt length - verbose instructions inflate every API call
- Truncate or summarise conversation history for multi-turn applications
- Avoid sending redundant context in RAG pipelines

### Context window management

Monitor and alert on:
- Average input token count per request
- P95 and P99 input token counts
- Agents or features that silently inflate context (tool results, retrieval dumps)

### Fine-tuning cost awareness

Fine-tuned model deployments incur both training token charges (one-time) and
ongoing hosting charges (per hour, even when idle). Track these separately from
inference token costs.

### Non-production waste on provisioned capacity

Development, test, and QA environments rarely require guaranteed throughput or low
latency SLAs. Running them on PTU-provisioned capacity adds a premium without
delivering production value.

- Identify non-production deployments by linking deployment metadata to environment
  tags (Environment: dev / test / staging)
- Move non-production workloads to standard (PAYG) tier - they benefit from
  spillover tolerance and can absorb occasional throttling
- Reserve PTU allocations for production workloads with consistent, latency-sensitive
  demand
- This is one of the highest-ROI, lowest-risk optimisations available on Azure OpenAI

### Use case economics: beyond token totals

Token spend is the most visible driver of Azure OpenAI costs, but it is not the complete
picture. A single AI feature or application may combine multiple model calls, retrieval
steps, supporting cloud services, and integration layers. Each component adds cost.

**The unit metric that matters is cost per business outcome** - cost per resolved
support ticket, cost per generated document, cost per completed transaction - not
cost per token. This outcome-based view:

- Provides a common frame of reference for engineering and finance teams
- Makes it possible to evaluate whether an AI feature is financially viable
- Guides optimisation priorities: a 20% token reduction on a low-volume workflow
  has less impact than a 10% reduction on a high-volume one

To build use case economics:
1. Instrument applications to log token counts per request, per feature, and per
   user journey - not just in aggregate
2. Map token costs to business transactions using application-level logging or
   middleware
3. Establish a cost-per-outcome baseline, then track it over time as models and
   architectures change
4. Use this data to prioritise optimisation work: focus on the use cases where
   cost-per-outcome is highest relative to the business value delivered

Without this instrumentation layer, optimisation remains reactive and teams cannot
distinguish which AI investments are efficient from which are not.

### Azure Hybrid Benefit and MACC

Azure OpenAI Service spend can count toward Microsoft Azure Consumption Commitments
(MACC) in enterprise agreements. Verify this with your Microsoft account team  -
it affects how GenAI spend is credited against existing commitments.

## Governance checklist

- [ ] Enable Azure Cost Management for OpenAI resources and configure daily anomaly alerts
- [ ] Define model selection policy - default to lower-cost tiers unless justified
- [ ] Instrument applications with token counts per request (input + output + cached)
- [ ] Instrument at the use-case level - track cost per business outcome, not just aggregate tokens
- [ ] Use resource groups or subscriptions for team/environment cost separation
- [ ] Tag all OpenAI resources with owner, team, environment, and cost centre
- [ ] Define deployment locality per workload based on compliance requirements - do not default to Regional unless required
- [ ] Monitor PTU utilisation and unallocated PTUs monthly
- [ ] Track spillover volume and cost as a separate budget line
- [ ] Move non-production workloads (dev/test/QA) to PAYG - remove from PTU allocations
- [ ] Review fine-tuned model hosting charges - decommission idle fine-tuned deployments
- [ ] Establish a model modernisation cadence - review deployed model versions quarterly against current Azure OpenAI catalog
- [ ] Verify whether OpenAI spend counts toward MACC commitments
- [ ] Establish a model review cadence - Azure OpenAI model catalog updates frequently
