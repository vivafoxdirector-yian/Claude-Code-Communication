# FinOps Chargeback

> Chargeback is the financial-accountability extension of allocation and
> showback. Allocation distributes cost visibility (`finops-allocation-showback.md`).
> Chargeback distributes financial responsibility - costs flow into team
> budgets and, eventually, team P&L. The capability lives in the FinOps
> Framework's "Manage the FinOps Practice" domain because chargeback is an
> accounting and governance transaction, not a reporting transaction.
>
> This file assumes allocation and showback are in place at Walk maturity.
> If they are not, start with `finops-allocation-showback.md` first - this
> file's recommendations are premature otherwise.

## Prerequisite check

Before any chargeback discussion is meaningful, the following must be true:

- Tagging at >80% allocation (see `finops-tagging.md`)
- Allocation pipeline producing `EffectiveCost`-based per-team views (see
  `finops-allocation-showback.md`)
- Showback reports running at fixed cadence with documented allocation
  methodology
- At least two quarters of stable showback with disputes resolved on data
  quality, not on methodology
- Invoice reconciliation via `InvoiceId` is clean and audited monthly
- Unallocated spend < 10%

If any of these is missing, start there. Chargeback built on a shaky
allocation foundation amplifies every weakness in the upstream pipeline and
exposes them to Finance, Tax, and the receiving teams simultaneously.

---

## Why chargeback comes after showback

Allocation and showback distribute information. Chargeback distributes
consequences. The first requires data and tooling. The second requires
organisational readiness, executive sponsorship, accounting-system
configuration, tax review, and cultural change.

Skipping the showback phase is the most expensive recoverable mistake in
FinOps practice maturity. The failure shape is consistent:

- Finance imposes chargeback on engineering teams that have never seen their
  costs broken down before. Numbers feel arbitrary because the methodology
  has not been socialised through showback.
- Engineering disputes the allocation keys because no one has explained how
  shared services were attributed.
- The first wave of disputes lands on FinOps as a noise tax, not a useful
  signal. FinOps spends weeks defending the model rather than improving it.
- Leadership sponsorship erodes. Chargeback is paused, sometimes permanently.
  Twelve to eighteen months of credibility takes another two years to rebuild.

The cost of this failure is not the engineering time spent on disputes. It is
the organisational unwillingness to attempt chargeback again for a generation
of leadership. The recovery path is to restart at showback and earn the
upgrade.

---

## The two chargeback tiers

Chargeback is not a single state. There are two distinct tiers, separated by
whether allocated cost flows to team P&L.

| Tier | What it is | What teams experience | Maturity gate to advance |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Soft chargeback** | Costs affect team budgets (variance vs target) but do not flow to P&L. The cost line is real to the team but does not move the company's reported segment margin. | Budget pressure: managers see allocated cost in their monthly variance pack. Overspend is a conversation, not a bonus impact. | At least two quarters of soft chargeback with allocation keys unchanged, dispute rate trending down, methodology disputes closed against the decision log not opened anew |
| **Hard chargeback** | Costs hit team P&L and feed into headcount and capacity decisions. Recharge transactions post as accounting journals to the receiving cost centre. | Real financial pressure: division GMs whose bonuses are tied to operating margin will see margin move from cloud cost. | Annual financial cycle includes chargeback as a planning input; no methodology disputes outstanding; CFO and Controller signed off on the methodology and the supporting controls |

**Hard chargeback is not the goal for every organisation.** Many operate at
soft chargeback indefinitely because the political and operational cost of
hard chargeback exceeds the value it delivers. Default to "advance the next
tier when the current one is stable", not "always be advancing".

**Cadence guideline:** plan one tier upgrade per year. Faster timelines are
usually a sign of leadership pressure that engineering will push back against
once the numbers become real.

## Finance and accounting prerequisites for hard chargeback

Allocation methodology is the FinOps half of chargeback. The Finance,
Controller, and Tax half determines whether hard chargeback is operationally
possible at all. A FinOps team that designs an elegant allocation model and
hands it to Finance only to discover the ERP cannot post the journals has
burned six to nine months. Surface these questions early - ideally during
soft chargeback - so the hard-chargeback go-live date is set against real
operational constraints rather than aspiration.

### Provider invoicing mechanisms

Some clients do not want an internal journal at all. They want the cloud provider to
issue a separate invoice per business unit. That is a different request, and it has to
be mapped to the provider's own invoicing construct before any chargeback design work
starts - an allocation model cannot produce an invoice.

- **AWS** - the construct is an **invoice unit** (Invoice Configuration). It produces a
  genuinely separate invoice document per unit while keeping one AWS Organization,
  consolidated billing and volume tiering. Cost Categories do not do this; they are a
  reporting layer with no effect on the invoice. See "AWS billing hierarchy and separate
  invoices" in `finops-aws.md`.
- **Azure** - the construct is a **Billing Profile** under MCA. One Billing Profile
  generates one monthly invoice, and the payment method attaches there. **Invoice
  Sections are lines inside one invoice, not separate invoices**, and **reservations sit
  on the Billing Profile**, not on the Invoice Section - so a BU mapped to an Invoice
  Section cannot be given its own invoice or its own reservation attribution natively.
  See "MCA hierarchy (four billing levels)" in `finops-azure.md`.

Two cases, and they are not the same problem:

1. **Separate invoice documents, same paying entity.** Central IT still pays the
   provider; the business units receive their own invoice document for internal
   visibility and PO matching. This is mostly an allocation problem with a presentation
   layer on top. Finance involvement is real but bounded: cost centres, PO ownership,
   and who reconciles the documents against the payment.
2. **Distinct paying entities.** Each business unit is a separate legal entity that pays
   the provider itself, or is recharged across an entity boundary. This is a contractual
   and tax problem before it is a FinOps one - transfer pricing applies (see below),
   the entity and VAT number behind each invoice recipient has to be confirmed, and the
   provider's account team has to validate the arrangement.

Establish which of the two the client actually means at the first meeting. Case 1 is
weeks of configuration; case 2 is months, and most of the elapsed time is Tax and Legal
rather than anything a FinOps practitioner controls.

### Accounting system readiness

Hard chargeback is an accounting transaction. The receiving cost centre's P&L
takes a charge; the source cost centre's P&L sees the offsetting credit. The
ERP has to support this:

- **Chart of accounts** - is there an account code for cloud-cost recharges?
  Some organisations need to create one. Some need to split it (compute /
  storage / network / managed services) for downstream reporting.
- **Cost-centre setup** - every receiving team needs a cost centre that exists
  in the ERP, is open for posting, and is mapped to the right legal entity
  and reporting hierarchy. Acquired or recently-renamed teams often fail this
  check.
- **Inter-cost-centre transfer mechanism** - in SAP, this is CO module
  configuration (KSU3 cycles, SKF statistical key figures, or distribution
  cycles). In Oracle / Workday / NetSuite, the equivalents exist but require
  configuration. The FinOps team almost never owns this; the Controller does.
- **Posting cadence** - hard chargeback journals need to post inside the
  monthly close window (typically days 3-5 after period end). A FinOps
  allocation pipeline that delivers on day 10 is useless for hard chargeback
  regardless of how good the methodology is. Confirm the close calendar with
  Finance and engineer the pipeline backwards from it.

A practical first step: have FinOps and the Controller's office walk through
one mock chargeback journal end-to-end before any commitment is made on
go-live timing. Block-and-tackle issues (missing cost centre, account code
not yet created, cycle not configured) surface in hours instead of months.

### Inter-business-unit P&L impact

When Engineering's cloud spend gets recharged to Product Line A, A's operating
margin drops. A central IT cost line shrinks correspondingly. This is the
intended outcome - that is the entire point of hard chargeback. But the
side-effects need executive alignment before the first quarterly close lands:

- **Bonus and incentive plans** - division GMs whose bonuses are tied to
  operating margin will see margin move from causes outside their control
  unless their plan is updated to either (a) include cloud spend in their
  budget envelope, or (b) measure them on a margin metric that excludes
  recharged IT cost
- **Segment reporting** - public companies that report by segment need the
  CFO and Controller aligned on whether recharged cloud cost shows up in
  segment cost or as a corporate allocation. The choice affects analyst-facing
  metrics
- **Board-level reporting** - if board metrics include divisional gross or
  operating margin, the first quarter of chargeback will move those numbers
  in ways that need to be explained in advance, not discovered in a board
  pack
- **Budget process integration** - hard chargeback only works if the recharged
  cost is included in the receiving team's budget for the year. Otherwise the
  team posts variance every month against a budget that ignored the line.
  Hard chargeback go-live should align with the start of a fiscal year, not
  mid-year

The CFO has to be the executive sponsor of hard chargeback for this reason.
FinOps owns the methodology; the CFO owns the accounting and incentive
implications. Hard chargeback without CFO sponsorship reverts to soft
chargeback within two quarters.

### Transfer pricing (multi-entity groups)

Intercompany cloud recharges between legal entities are transfer-pricing
transactions. They need an arm's-length basis, supporting documentation, and
tax-team review. Most groups land on a cost-plus methodology (cost + 5-7%
margin) for centrally-procured cloud recharged to operating subsidiaries, but
the right answer depends on the local tax authority's expectations and the
group's existing transfer-pricing policy.

The pattern that breaks: a US parent procures cloud centrally and recharges
to a French operating subsidiary at exact cost. The French tax authority
re-characterises the transaction under their transfer-pricing rules, imputes
a margin, and assesses tax on the imputed amount. The remediation cost is
typically 2-4x the original tax delta.

Engage the tax team before chargeback crosses a legal-entity boundary. They
will tell you which methodology applies, what documentation is needed, and
whether an existing transfer-pricing study covers the new recharge or
requires an update.

### Cross-border tax mechanics

Cross-border intercompany services have additional considerations:

- **VAT / GST treatment** - in the EU, intercompany services across borders
  typically use the reverse-charge mechanism (the receiving entity self-assesses
  VAT and recovers it on the same return), but the rules vary by jurisdiction
  and by what the service is classified as. UK / EU / APAC each have their
  own treatments
- **Withholding tax** - some jurisdictions impose withholding on intercompany
  service payments; bilateral tax treaties usually provide relief but require
  documentation
- **Permanent establishment risk** - aggressive recharging from one entity to
  another can, in some structures, create PE exposure for the source entity
  in the destination country
- **Pillar 2 minimum tax (EU + OECD)** - for groups subject to the global
  minimum tax (revenue > €750M), the effective tax rate calculation in each
  jurisdiction picks up intercompany cost allocations. Material chargeback
  flows can shift jurisdictional ETRs and trigger top-up tax in unexpected
  places
- **US GILTI / FDII / BEAT** - for US-parented groups, intercompany cloud
  recharges interact with the international tax provisions in ways that are
  rarely intuitive

None of these are FinOps decisions. All of them mean "tax has to be in the
room before hard chargeback crosses a border."

### Audit trail and SOX-equivalent controls

Hard chargeback creates accounting transactions that auditors will sample.
The control framework needs evidence:

- **Source data immutability** - the FOCUS dataset (or equivalent) used for
  allocation must be archived in a form that cannot be altered after the
  close; auditors need to be able to reproduce the chargeback calculation
  for any closed period
- **Approval workflow** - the chargeback methodology and the monthly journals
  need documented approval before posting; "FinOps decided" is not an
  audit-acceptable approval chain
- **Segregation of duties** - the team that designs allocation keys should
  not be the team that posts the journals. In small organisations this is
  hard but achievable through ERP-level approver roles
- **Exception logging** - any manual override (e.g. correcting a previous
  month's chargeback in the current month) must be logged with rationale
  and approver
- **SOX or equivalent (US public, large EU)** - if the recharged amounts are
  material to a public company's segment reporting, the chargeback process
  becomes a SOX-relevant control. ICFR documentation, walkthroughs, and
  annual testing apply

Engage Internal Audit at the soft-chargeback stage, not at hard-chargeback
go-live. They will surface control gaps that take months to remediate.

### When to involve which Finance role

| Decision | Owner / co-owner |
|---|---|
| Allocation methodology design | FinOps + Controller (see `finops-allocation-showback.md`) |
| Cost-centre and chart-of-accounts setup | Controller |
| ERP transfer-mechanism configuration | Controller + IT-Finance |
| Inter-BU P&L impact and incentive-plan alignment | CFO + HR |
| Transfer pricing methodology | Tax team + external advisor (rarely Internal) |
| Cross-border tax treatment (VAT, withholding, PE) | Tax team + external advisor |
| Audit and SOX-relevant controls | Internal Audit + Controller |
| Budget process integration | FP&A + receiving-team Finance partners |

The FinOps practitioner's job is not to answer these questions; it is to
surface them at the right moment so the right Finance role can address them
before the hard-chargeback go-live commitment is made.

## Chargeback-specific cadence

The allocation pipeline runs daily; showback reports go out weekly and
monthly (see `finops-allocation-showback.md`). Chargeback adds a layer on top:

| Frequency | Activity | Audience |
|---|---|---|
| Monthly | Chargeback close: post journals to ERP within the close window (days 3-5 after period end), reconcile to invoice via `InvoiceId` | Controller + FinOps + receiving teams |
| Quarterly | True-ups: corrections to allocation methodology applied retroactively in the current period | Controller + FinOps + Finance partners |
| Annually | Methodology review: are the keys still defensible? Has the org structure changed? Is the tax position current? | CFO + Controller + Tax + Internal Audit + FinOps |

**Critical:** monthly with quarterly true-ups, never quarterly with annual
surprises. A team that learns it overspent its budget in January when the
quarterly close lands in April has lost three months of correction time. The
shorter the cycle, the smaller each correction needs to be.

True-ups are not optional. Allocation methodology imperfections compound
silently if not corrected on a fixed cadence. Run the quarterly true-up even
when nothing visible has changed - the discipline is what makes the
methodology trustworthy and audit-defensible.

---

## Methodology dispute process

Data-quality disputes belong to the allocation pipeline (see
`finops-allocation-showback.md`). Methodology disputes are different - the
team is not arguing the data is wrong; they are arguing the allocation key
itself is the wrong choice. Methodology disputes intensify at chargeback
because the numbers now have financial consequences.

A working methodology dispute process:

1. **Single intake channel** with a templated form: which line item, which
   team, what is being disputed, what the team thinks the correct allocation
   would be, and the operational metric they would prefer
2. **Triage SLA**: 5 business days to first response, 15 to first decision
3. **Quarterly methodology review** as the resolution forum: methodology
   disputes do not resolve per-incident; they aggregate into a quarterly
   review where the FinOps team plus Finance plus the receiving team's
   representative decide whether to change the key
4. **Decision log**: every methodology dispute that closes either with a
   change or a "no change" decision is logged with the rationale. Future
   disputes citing the same issue get pointed at the log and closed
5. **Dispute-throughput metrics**: track dispute count, resolution time
   against the triage SLA, and the top disputed cost classes at each
   quarterly review. At chargeback maturity these are audit-relevant -
   Internal Audit and the Controller expect evidence that disputes clear
   within SLA, not merely that they are counted. Rising resolution time is
   an early signal that the review forum is under-resourced, visible before
   a backlog shows up in the count.
6. **Annual methodology refresh**: the cumulative effect of methodology
   decisions over the year feeds into the annual methodology review (see
   cadence table above)

Treat methodology disputes as second-order signals: a rising dispute rate
in one cost class often means the allocation key is genuinely wrong, not
that the team is being unreasonable.

---

## Anti-patterns

- **Jumping straight to hard chargeback**. The chargeback-revolt failure
  mode. Cost: 12-18 months of credibility, recovery measured in years.
- **Hard chargeback without CFO sponsorship**. Reverts to soft chargeback
  within two quarters. The CFO owns the accounting and incentive
  implications; without that ownership, the first quarter of P&L surprise
  triggers a pause that is hard to reverse.
- **Hard chargeback go-live mid-fiscal-year**. Receiving teams have no
  budget for the recharged amount; every month posts variance. Align
  go-live with the start of a fiscal year.
- **Skipping the mock-journal walkthrough**. Designing the allocation model
  without confirming the ERP can post the journals is the most expensive
  way to discover the gap. Walk through one chargeback journal with the
  Controller before committing to the go-live date.
- **Cross-border chargeback without tax review**. Transfer-pricing
  re-characterisation costs typically 2-4x the original tax delta to
  remediate. Engage tax before crossing legal-entity boundaries.
- **Methodology changes mid-quarter**. Changes apply at quarterly true-ups,
  not in real time. Real-time methodology changes break trust in the numbers
  and create audit issues.
- **Manual political overrides at chargeback**. "Team A pays less because
  they're strategic" is indefensible at allocation; at chargeback it
  becomes an audit issue. Surface strategic subsidies elsewhere; keep the
  recharge methodology clean.
- **Treating chargeback as a FinOps deliverable**. Chargeback is a
  cross-functional accounting transaction. FinOps owns methodology design;
  the Controller owns the journals and the controls; the CFO owns the
  incentive implications; Tax owns the cross-border treatment. A "FinOps
  delivered chargeback" framing skips the people whose sign-off it requires.

## Maturity progression

### Walk - soft chargeback

- Allocation and showback at Walk maturity (see
  `finops-allocation-showback.md`)
- Soft chargeback active: allocated cost flows into team budget variance,
  not P&L
- Documented allocation methodology with stakeholder sign-off
- Methodology dispute process running with a quarterly resolution cadence
- Internal Audit engaged on the chargeback design (no SOX-equivalent
  testing yet)
- Conversations with Controller and CFO underway about the prerequisites
  for hard chargeback (ERP readiness, incentive-plan alignment)

### Run - hard chargeback

- Hard chargeback in production: allocated cost feeds team P&L
- ERP transfer mechanism configured and tested; journals post inside the
  monthly close window
- Cost-centre setup complete for all receiving teams; chart of accounts
  has the right codes
- CFO sign-off on the methodology; incentive plans updated to reflect
  recharged cost
- Tax position reviewed; transfer-pricing methodology documented for any
  intercompany flows; cross-border treatment (VAT, withholding,
  Pillar 2 / GILTI) confirmed
- SOX-equivalent controls in place if material; ICFR documented; annual
  testing performed
- Methodology version-controlled and reviewed annually with explicit
  stakeholder sign-off (CFO + Controller + Tax + Internal Audit + FinOps)
- Recharged cost included in receiving teams' annual budget envelope from
  the start of the fiscal year
