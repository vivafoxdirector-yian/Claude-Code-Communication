# AWS Zombie NAT Gateway

## Problem

An AWS NAT Gateway is billed at roughly $0.045/hr per gateway plus
$0.045/GB of data processed (us-east-1 rate; several regions run
materially higher - Sao Paulo and some Asia-Pacific regions up to roughly
double - so estimate savings per region, never from one rate). The hourly
charge alone is about $32/month per gateway, accrued whether traffic flows
or not. A NAT Gateway processing near-zero data still pays the full hourly.
Multiply across accounts, AZs, and forgotten migration leftovers and the
waste compounds quickly. Every dollar figure in this playbook is an
illustrative list rate written between May and August 2026 - verify
against live pricing for the regions in scope before sizing a business
case.

## Symptoms

- CloudWatch `BytesOutToSource` + `BytesOutToDestination` < 5 GB / month
- Private subnet has few or no running workloads
- The NAT was created during a migration project that has ended months ago
- An account has multiple NAT Gateways but only one or two AZs see real
  egress
- The owning team / cost-centre tag is empty or stale

## Detection

```sql
-- Athena over CUR 2.0: NAT Gateway hours vs data processed, last two full
-- months. The window is deliberately 60 days, not one month: some workloads
-- run quarterly, and a single quiet month would misclassify them.
-- The NatGateway-Bytes usage amount is already reported in GB (the pricing
-- unit), despite the usage-type name - do not divide it down from bytes.
-- gb_per_month is that GB figure divided by 2, i.e. the monthly average over
-- the two-month window, so the < 5 GB/month threshold reads the same as the
-- CloudWatch symptom above.
SELECT
  line_item_resource_id           AS nat_id,
  line_item_availability_zone     AS az,
  SUM(CASE WHEN line_item_usage_type LIKE '%NatGateway-Hours' THEN line_item_usage_amount END) AS hours,
  COALESCE(SUM(CASE WHEN line_item_usage_type LIKE '%NatGateway-Bytes' THEN line_item_usage_amount END), 0) / 2 AS gb_per_month,
  SUM(line_item_unblended_cost)   AS cost_period
FROM cur2
WHERE line_item_usage_start_date >= date_trunc('month', current_date - interval '2' month)
  AND line_item_usage_start_date <  date_trunc('month', current_date)
  AND product_servicecode = 'AmazonEC2'
  AND line_item_usage_type LIKE '%NatGateway%'
GROUP BY 1, 2
-- COALESCE matters: a NAT with literally zero traffic produces no
-- NatGateway-Bytes line items at all, so the bare SUM returns NULL and
-- NULL < 5 filters out exactly the clearest zombies.
HAVING COALESCE(SUM(CASE WHEN line_item_usage_type LIKE '%NatGateway-Bytes' THEN line_item_usage_amount END), 0) / 2 < 5
ORDER BY cost_period DESC;
```

This query finds the idle end of the distribution. A *high-traffic* NAT
moving mostly S3 or DynamoDB data is a different and usually larger
finding - gateway-endpoint substitution eliminates its per-GB processing
fee entirely - and is deliberately out of this playbook's scope.

For real-time validation, the canonical CloudWatch metrics are
`BytesOutToSource` and `BytesOutToDestination` in the `AWS/NATGateway`
namespace, dimensioned by `NatGatewayId`, at 1-minute granularity.

## Fix

Detection needs only the billing signal above - that is what makes this
pattern `obvious` in the confidence model. The steps below are the
pre-deletion safety validation, not part of classification: you classify
on one signal, you delete only after confirming.

1. Confirm the gateway has < 5 GB / month over a 60-day window - the
   Detection query above already spans two full months for exactly this
   reason (one month can be misleading - some workloads run quarterly).
2. Identify the route table(s) pointing at the gateway. If no private
   subnet routes to it, deletion is safe.
3. Delete the NAT Gateway. Release the associated Elastic IP if no other
   resource needs it - since February 2024 every public IPv4 address costs
   $0.005/hr (~$3.60/month) whether it is attached to anything or not, so
   an address left behind keeps billing.
4. If a residual workload still needs occasional internet egress, evaluate
   whether **VPC Endpoints** can replace the NAT entirely. Two endpoint types
   with very different cost profiles:
   - **Gateway endpoints** (S3, DynamoDB only): no hourly charge, no data
     processing fee. Always cheaper than routing the same traffic through a
     NAT Gateway.
   - **Interface endpoints / PrivateLink** (most other AWS services and
     third-party SaaS): hourly charge per endpoint per AZ (~$0.01/hr =
     ~$7.30/month/AZ) plus a data-processing fee per GB. For
     low-traffic services across multiple AZs, an interface endpoint can
     end up costing more than the NAT it replaced. Compare endpoint cost
     against the NAT's data-processing volume before swapping.

## Anti-pattern

- Deleting a NAT Gateway during a migration cutover window without
  confirming the new path. Lambda warmups, cron jobs, and external
  webhooks fail silently and only surface in operational alerts hours
  later.
- Replacing a per-AZ NAT Gateway with a single cross-AZ NAT to "save
  money" - cross-AZ data transfer ($0.01/GB each direction, so $0.02/GB
  round-trip) often outweighs the saved NAT hours, AND introduces a
  single-AZ failure mode.
