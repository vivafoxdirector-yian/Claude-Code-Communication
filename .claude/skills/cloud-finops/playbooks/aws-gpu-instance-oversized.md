# AWS Oversized GPU Instance

## Problem

GPU instances are the most expensive on-demand SKUs in EC2. A `g5.xlarge`
(A10G, 24 GB) is ~$1.00/hour ~= $730/month; a `g5.12xlarge` (4 x A10G)
is ~$5.67/hour ~= $4,140/month; a `p4d.24xlarge` (8 x A100 40 GB) is
~$21.96/hour ~= $16,030/month. Picking an instance with more GPU compute
and memory than the workload uses is one of the highest-dollar waste
patterns in AWS - and one of the hardest to spot, because the basic
GPU-utilisation metric most teams reach for (`nvidia-smi`'s `GPU-Util`,
surfaced by the CloudWatch agent as `nvidia_smi_utilization_gpu`) reports
whether the GPU did anything in the interval, not how much of its compute
capacity was actually used (see
[finops-for-ai.md](../references/finops-for-ai.md), section on GPU
telemetry). The rates above are illustrative us-east-1 on-demand list
prices written between May and August 2026 - verify against live pricing
before quoting.

## Symptoms

- `nvidia_smi_utilization_gpu` < 30% over a 14-day window (CloudWatch agent,
  `CWAgent` namespace - EC2 publishes no GPU metrics natively)
- `nvidia_smi_utilization_memory` < 40% over the same window
- The model's loaded weights fit in well under half of the GPU memory
- Model latency p95 is far below the SLA (room to move to a smaller GPU
  without violating user-facing budgets)
- The instance was picked because "we always use g5.12xlarge for ML" or
  "the model file is large" rather than from measurement

## Detection

Two-tier signal: cheap (CloudWatch) for triage, expensive (DCGM) for the
real decision.

CloudWatch quick scan. **Prerequisite:** EC2 publishes no GPU metrics of its
own - `AWS/EC2` has no `GPUUtilization`. GPU telemetry on EC2 requires the
CloudWatch agent configured with its NVIDIA GPU section, which publishes
`nvidia_smi_*` metrics into the `CWAgent` namespace. If the command below
returns no datapoints, the agent is not collecting GPU metrics on that
instance; that is the first thing to fix, not evidence the GPU is idle.

```
aws cloudwatch get-metric-statistics \
  --namespace CWAgent \
  --metric-name nvidia_smi_utilization_gpu \
  --dimensions Name=InstanceId,Value=<id> \
  --start-time $(date -u -d '14 days ago' +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ) \
  --end-time   $(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ) \
  --period 3600 --statistics Average,Maximum
```

Confirm the metric exists before trusting an empty result:

```
aws cloudwatch list-metrics --namespace CWAgent \
  --metric-name nvidia_smi_utilization_gpu \
  --dimensions Name=InstanceId,Value=<id>
```

Note: `nvidia_smi_utilization_gpu` is the `nvidia-smi` `GPU-Util` figure and
overestimates real compute usage for the reason described above. Treat any
value < 30% as "investigate further", not "definitely oversized".

(On SageMaker the equivalent metric *is* native: `GPUUtilization` in the
`/aws/sagemaker/Endpoints` namespace. That is a different playbook - see
`aws-sagemaker-idle-endpoint.md`.)

DCGM (deploy DCGM Exporter on the instance via SSM or Helm) gives the
honest answer:

| Metric | Threshold for "oversized" |
|---|---|
| `DCGM_FI_PROF_GR_ENGINE_ACTIVE` | < 20% over 14 days |
| `DCGM_FI_PROF_SM_ACTIVE` | < 25% over 14 days |
| `DCGM_FI_PROF_PIPE_TENSOR_ACTIVE` | < 15% for ML inference workloads |
| `DCGM_FI_DEV_FB_USED` | < 40% of total frame buffer |

If three of the four are below threshold, the instance is a strong
rightsize candidate.

## Fix

1. **Identify the target instance type.** Smaller in the same family
   first (`g5.12xlarge` → `g5.4xlarge` → `g5.xlarge`), then cross-family
   if memory or compute profile changes (G5 → G6 for L4 efficiency; P4d →
   G5 if A100 perf is overkill; G5 → Inf2 if model is supported on AWS
   Neuron).
2. **Benchmark on the target.** Run the production workload (same model,
   same batch size, same load pattern) on the target instance for 24-48
   hours. Compare `ModelLatency` p50/p95/p99 and `ThroughputPerInstance`.
3. **Validate peak.** Average utilisation hides bursts. Replay peak hour
   traffic against the candidate; check that latency stays inside SLA at
   2x peak.
4. **Validate memory.** Confirm the model + activations + KV cache (for
   LLMs) fits within the target's frame buffer with 20% headroom for
   request-size variability.
5. **Cut over incrementally** so a regression is reversible: shift a fraction
   of the fleet (or of the load-balancer target weights) to the new instance
   type, 10% → 50% → 100%, holding at each step long enough to see a full
   traffic cycle. Keep the old capacity until the last step completes.
   (If the workload is behind a SageMaker endpoint rather than raw EC2, the
   equivalent is an `InitialVariantWeight` ramp across production variants -
   see `aws-sagemaker-idle-endpoint.md`.)

## Anti-pattern

- Rightsizing on **average** utilisation only. Models with batch jobs,
  monthly retraining, or end-of-quarter spikes will look oversized for 28
  days then break on day 29.
- Trusting `GPU-Util` (`nvidia_smi_utilization_gpu` / `nvidia-smi`) without DCGM
  cross-check. The metric is a "did the GPU do anything" boolean dressed
  up as a percentage - a workload touching 1 SM out of 132 on an H100 SXM
  (114 on the PCIe part) reports `GPU-Util: 100%`.
- Picking a smaller instance whose frame buffer is too small for the
  model. Always size on memory first, compute second.
- Forgetting that lower-tier GPUs may need a different software stack
  (CUDA version, driver, framework backend) - test the full stack, not
  just the model file.
