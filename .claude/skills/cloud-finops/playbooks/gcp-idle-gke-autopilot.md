# GCP Idle GKE Autopilot Cluster

## Problem

GKE charges a flat **cluster management fee** (~$0.10/cluster/hour =
~$72/month per cluster) regardless of workload activity. Even when no user
workloads run, Autopilot keeps system-managed pods alive (control-plane
logging, metrics agent, GMP collectors, networking). Dev / test / sandbox
clusters left running over weekends and abandoned-after-the-PoC clusters
accumulate this fee silently. The management fee above is an illustrative
list rate as at August 2026 - verify against live pricing before sizing a
business case.

Two caveats before you build a business case on the management fee:

- **The GKE free tier covers one zonal or Autopilot cluster per billing
  account**, so the *first* idle cluster may cost nothing in management fee.
  The waste is real from the second cluster onward - and organisations with
  the pattern this playbook describes usually have many.
- **Autopilot's workload billing depends on the compute class.** The
  per-pod-request model applies to the general-purpose class; Autopilot also
  supports node-based billing for some workloads (Performance and Accelerator
  compute classes bill for the underlying node, not the pod request). Check
  which class the workloads use before assuming zero pods means zero
  workload cost.

## Symptoms

- Cluster has fewer than 5 user-namespace pods running
- Last `kubectl apply` or commit to the GitOps repo touching this
  cluster is older than 30 days
- The cluster lives in an environment-named project (`*-dev-*`,
  `*-sandbox-*`, `*-poc-*`) that has matured past its initial purpose
- Cost-per-cluster trend is flat at the management-fee floor (~$72/mo
  for Autopilot, more if there is any pod activity)

## Detection

```sql
-- BigQuery billing export: GKE Autopilot management fee + minimum compute
SELECT
  project.id                              AS project,
  resource.global_name                    AS cluster,
  SUM(cost) / NULLIF(SUM(usage.amount), 0) AS unit_cost,
  SUM(cost)                               AS cost_30d
FROM `<project>.<dataset>.gcp_billing_export_resource_v1_<account>`
WHERE _PARTITIONTIME >= TIMESTAMP_SUB(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL 30 DAY)
  AND service.description = 'Kubernetes Engine'
  AND sku.description LIKE '%Autopilot%'
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY cost_30d DESC;
```

```bash
# For each suspect cluster, count user-namespace pods
gcloud container clusters get-credentials <cluster> --region <region> --project <project>
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces \
  -o json | jq '[.items[] | select(.metadata.namespace | test("^(kube-|gke-|gmp-)") | not)] | length'
```

## Fix

1. **For dev / sandbox clusters**: delete the cluster. Re-create on demand
   from Terraform / GitOps when needed - GKE Autopilot cluster creation
   is fast (5-10 min).
2. **For low-traffic shared clusters**: consolidate workloads onto one
   shared cluster across teams via namespace isolation. Saves the per-
   cluster management fee, trades against blast-radius concerns.
3. **For automatically-provisioned PoC clusters**: build a GitHub /
   GitLab Action that auto-deletes clusters after 14 days of no activity.
   Tag the cluster with `expires-on=YYYY-MM-DD` at creation; the action
   reaps anything past that.
4. **Replace with serverless alternatives** where the workload fits:
   Cloud Run for stateless HTTP, Cloud Functions for event-driven, GKE
   Standard with Spot VMs for batch.

## Anti-pattern

- Deleting a GKE cluster without dumping persistent volumes first.
  Autopilot clusters with attached PDs that have `reclaimPolicy: Retain`
  leave the PDs behind (a different orphan pattern - see
  `playbooks/gcp-orphan-persistent-disks.md`), but data inside the PV
  may still be needed and the cluster delete loses Helm release
  history.
- Aggressive consolidation onto one shared cluster across security
  boundaries. Multi-tenant Autopilot is feasible but namespace-level
  RBAC + NetworkPolicies must be in place; mixing prod and untrusted
  PoC namespaces in one cluster creates lateral-movement risk.
